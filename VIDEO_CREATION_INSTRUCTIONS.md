## Troubleshooting

### "NotebookLM won't accept my file"
- **Solution:** The file is a .md (markdown) file. If it won't upload, rename it to .txt
- Or copy/paste the content into NotebookLM's text input

### "Audio is too long"
- **This is normal!** Comprehensive training = longer audio
- **Solution:** Use chapter breakdown to create shorter segments
- Or speed up playback to 1.25x or 1.5x

### "I want different voices or style"
- **NotebookLM chooses voices automatically**
- **Can't change:** Voice selection is automatic
- **Alternative:** Use the audio as a script and record your own

### "Can I edit the script before generating?"
- **Yes!** Edit S21_ROOFER_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md before uploading
- Remove chapters you don't need
- Add company-specific information
- Adjust examples to your market

---

## Alternative: Multiple Short Videos

Instead of one 60-minute video, create several focused videos:

### Method:
1. **Edit the script file** - Keep only one chapter
2. **Upload to NotebookLM** - Generate audio for that chapter
3. **Repeat** for each chapter

### Result:
- "Susan Chat Tutorial" (7 minutes)
- "Email Generator Guide" (7 minutes)
- "Agnes Objection Handling" (6 minutes)
- "Voice Transcription How-To" (6 minutes)
- Etc.

### Benefits:
- Shorter, more digestible content
- Target specific training needs
- Easier to share via email
- Less overwhelming for new reps
