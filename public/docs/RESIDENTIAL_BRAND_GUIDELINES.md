Trademark Use and Brand Guidelines for  
Contractors Enrolled in a GAF Residential Roofing  
Contractor Certification Program
These Trademark Use and Brand Guidelines (“Guidelines”) 
apply to contractors enrolled in a residential roofing contractor 
certification program (“Program”) offered by GAF Materials LLC  
or GAF Canada ULC (collectively, “GAF,” “we,” “our,” or “us”)  
and are a part of the agreement between GAF and you with 
respect to your participation in such Program (“Agreement”). 
Your use of GAF trademarks, service marks, certification 
marks, badges, logos, and other designations, identified 
herein or otherwise identified by GAF, whether registered or 
not, (collectively, the “GAF Marks”) must comply with these 
Guidelines, which we may update from time to time by posting 
an updated version to gaf.com/Brand-Guidelines and  
any other instructions and conditions that GAF may provide  
to you regarding the GAF Marks.
As a valued member of the Program, we give you access to 
a variety of free GAF-branded marketing materials, such as 
brochures and sell sheets, to help you educate your customers 
about GAF products, services, and contractor certifications.  
We also offer paid co-branded marketing materials, such as 
business cards, folders, and lawn signs, that you can customize 
with your own company name or logo. To view available 
materials, log in to the GAF Partner Portal and click on the  
link for the GAF Online Store or visit gaf.com to download  
GAF brochures and sell sheets. 
You may also create your own advertising and marketing 
materials to identify your Certification(s), and advertise, promote, 
and sell GAF products and services that you offer in your 
Designated Territory so long as the information that you provide 
is truthful, accurate, and not misleading, and your use of GAF 
Marks complies with these Guidelines and the other terms of the 
Agreement, including, without limitation, the Program Guidelines 
referenced in, and incorporated into, the Agreement. 
To access appropriate contractor certification logos  
and documents, log in to the GAF Partner Portal and  
go to the GAF Marketing Documents section of the  
Document Library. 
If you have questions about the proper use of GAF Marks,  
please contact ccp@gaf.com.

1  Contractors enrolled in GAF certification programs are not employees or agents of GAF, and GAF does not control or otherwise supervise these independent 
businesses. Contractors may receive benefits, such as loyalty rewards points and discounts on marketing tools from GAF for participating in the program and 
offering GAF enhanced warranties, which require the use of a minimum amount of GAF products. 
 
†  Lifetime refers to the length of warranty coverage provided and means as long as the original individual owner(s) of a single-family detached residence [or eligible 
second owner(s)] owns the property where the qualifying GAF products are installed. For other owners/structures, Lifetime coverage is not applicable. Lifetime 
coverage on shingles requires the use of GAF Lifetime Shingles only. See the GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited Warranty for complete coverage and restrictions.

Limited Warranty, see the GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited Warranty. Visit gaf.com/LRS for qualifying GAF products.
