# State-Specific Matching Requirements

## Critical Information for Insurance Claims

### Maryland (MD) - Matching IS Required

**Maryland DOES require insurance companies to account for matching.**

- Use matching arguments aggressively in MD claims
- IRC R908.3 matching requirements fully apply
- Insurance must pay for full replacement if matching is impossible
- This is your strongest argument in MD

### Virginia (VA) & Pennsylvania (PA) - Matching NOT Required

**Virginia and Pennsylvania do NOT require insurance companies to account for matching.**

- Matching only applies if homeowner has a matching endorsement on their policy
- **CRITICAL: Do NOT use matching arguments in VA/PA unless you confirm they have a matching endorsement**
- Using matching arguments in VA/PA without endorsement will FAIL

### Alternative Arguments for VA & PA

When you cannot use matching arguments (VA/PA without endorsement), use these instead:

#### 1. Repairability Arguments

- **Brittle Test**: Shingles too brittle to repair without breaking
- **Repair Attempt**: Document failed repair attempts showing damage spreads
- Use these to prove repair is not feasible

#### 2. Differing Dimensions

- New materials don't match dimensions of existing materials
- Cannot achieve proper installation per manufacturer specs
- Code violations due to improper fitment

#### 3. Missed Storm Damage

- Areas not yet approved for replacement show storm damage
- Comprehensive inspection reveals additional damage
- Storm pattern indicates broader damage than initially assessed

#### 4. Other State-Specific Code Violations

- Building code violations unrelated to matching
- Safety concerns
- Warranty voiding

### Strategy Summary

| State | Matching Argument | Primary Strategy |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **MD** | ✅ YES - Use aggressively | IRC R908.3 matching requirements |
| **VA** | ❌ NO (unless endorsement) | Repairability, dimensions, missed damage |
| **PA** | ❌ NO (unless endorsement) | Repairability, dimensions, missed damage |

### Before Every Claim

**Always ask:**
1. What state is this property in?
2. (If VA/PA) Does the policy have a matching endorsement?

This determines your entire strategy and success probability.
