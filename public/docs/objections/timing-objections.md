# Timing & Decision Objections - Roof-ER Sales Responses

## "I need to think about it" Objections

### Objection 1: "I need to think about it / talk to my spouse"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge & Validate**
"That makes perfect sense. This is a major decision, and you absolutely should discuss it with your spouse."

**Step 2: Uncover the Real Objection**
"Just so I can help address any concerns - is there something specific you'd like to think about? Is it:
- The investment amount?
- The warranty coverage?
- The timeline for installation?
- Something about our company?

Knowing what's on your mind helps me provide the right information for your decision."

**Step 3: Trial Close**
"If we could address [their concern], would you be ready to move forward today?"

**Step 4: Create Action Plan**
"Here's what I suggest:
1. I'll email you a detailed proposal with everything we discussed
2. You discuss it with your spouse tonight
3. I'll call you tomorrow at [specific time] to answer any questions
4. If you're ready to move forward, we can lock in [benefit - pricing/scheduling/promotion]

Does that work for you?"

**Step 5: Plant Urgency Seed**
"One thing to consider while you're thinking - we have [specific benefit]:
- Only 2 installation slots left this month
- Current material pricing expires [date]
- Storm damage claim deadlines (insurance requires action within 1 year)
- Pre-season scheduling (summer gets booked 6-8 weeks out)

I don't want you to miss out if you decide this is the right choice."

### Objection 2: "Now is not a good time / Too busy right now"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Empathize**
"I totally understand - life is busy, and adding a major project feels overwhelming."

**Step 2: Reframe Timeline**
"Here's the good news about our process - it's actually designed for busy homeowners:

**Your Time Investment:**
- Initial consultation: 1 hour (already done!)
- Contract signing: 15 minutes (can be done electronically)
- Installation day: You don't need to be home
- Final walkthrough: 20 minutes

**Total time from you:** Less than 2 hours

**Our Time Investment:**
- Scheduling & permits: We handle
- Material ordering: We handle
- Installation: 1-2 days (we're here, you're not)
- Cleanup: Included
- Inspection: We coordinate"

**Step 3: Address the Inconvenience**
"I hear 'not a good time' a lot, and it usually means:
- Worried about disruption to daily routine
- Concerned about mess/noise
- Dealing with other priorities

Here's how we minimize disruption:
- Install in 1-2 days (not weeks)
- You can be at work - we don't need you home
- Protect landscaping, driveway, pool, etc.
- Magnetic sweeper removes all nails
- Complete cleanup same day as installation
- Inspections scheduled around your availability"

**Step 4: Cost of Delay**
"I understand if you want to wait, but consider:
- Every day that passes, water intrusion worsens
- A $15,000 roof replacement can become $25,000 with interior damage
- Insurance claim deadlines (storm damage must be filed within 12 months)
- Spring/summer booking fills up 6-8 weeks in advance

What if we scheduled installation for [4-6 weeks out]? That gives you time to prepare, and locks in current pricing and availability."

### Objection 3: "I want to wait until spring/summer / Better weather"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
"I hear that a lot! Most people think roofing is seasonal work."

**Step 2: Educate on Year-Round Installation**
"Here's what most homeowners don't know:

**Modern roofing can be installed year-round IF:**
- Temperatures are above 40°F during installation
- No active rain/snow during installation
- Shingles are stored in warm environment (we do this)
- Installers use proper techniques for cold weather

**Benefits of Off-Season Installation:**
1. **Better availability** (2-3 week wait vs 6-8 weeks in summer)
2. **Better pricing** (less demand = better deals)
3. **More experienced crews** (our full-time pros, not summer temps)
4. **More attention** (we're focused on your project, not juggling 20 jobs)

**Step 3: Address Weather Concerns**
"Your concern about weather is valid. Here's our guarantee:
- We monitor 10-day forecasts
- We only install on dry days above 40°F
- If weather turns bad, we reschedule (no charge)
- Our crews are experienced in optimal temperature installation
- Manufacturer warranties are valid year-round (as long as temps are appropriate)

In fact, fall/winter installations often LAST LONGER because:
- Shingles seal properly in moderate temperatures
- No thermal shock from extreme summer heat
- Proper acclimation time before installation"

**Step 4: Risk of Waiting**
"Here's what worries me about waiting:
- **4-6 months of exposure** = more water damage ($5,000-15,000 repairs)
- **Spring booking surge** = 6-8 week wait when you call in March
- **Material price increases** = 8-12% annually
- **Lost installation slots** = we book spring/summer in January-February

**Example:** Last year, homeowners who waited from November to April:
- Paid $1,800 more due to price increases
- Waited 7 weeks for installation (vs 2 weeks in winter)
- Some had emergency tarping needs ($800-1,500)
- One had ceiling collapse from water damage ($8,000 repair)

Can we at least get you on the schedule for [early date]? If you change your mind, you can always reschedule."

### Objection 4: "I need to save up more money first"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
"I respect that - financial planning is important."

**Step 2: Present Financing Immediately**
"That's exactly why we offer financing:

**Option 1: 0% Interest for 12 Months**
- Pay off within 12 months = no interest
- $15,000 roof = $1,250/month
- Same as saving up, but you're protected NOW

**Option 2: Low Monthly Payments**
- $150/month for 10 years (6.99% APR)
- Fits most budgets
- Same-day approval
- No impact to credit score for pre-approval

**Option 3: Insurance Coverage**
- Many homeowners don't realize storm damage is covered
- You only pay deductible ($500-2,500)
- We handle entire insurance claim
- Free inspection to see if you qualify"

**Step 3: Cost of Delay Math**
"Let me show you the math on waiting:

**If You Save for 6 Months:**
- Month 1-6: Save $2,500/month = $15,000 saved
- During this time:
  - Water damage worsens ($2,000-8,000 repair costs)
  - Material prices increase 4-6% ($600-900 more)
  - Emergency tarping if storm hits ($1,000-2,000)
  - Potential insurance denial (pre-existing damage)
- **Total Cost:** $15,000 + $3,600-11,900 damage = $18,600-26,900

**If You Finance Now:**
- Finance $15,000 at 0% for 12 months
- Pay $1,250/month (same as savings plan)
- No water damage
- Locked-in pricing
- Insurance protection starts immediately
- **Total Cost:** $15,000 (exactly what you'd save anyway)

You save $3,600-11,900 by acting NOW vs waiting to save."

**Step 4: Emergency Fund Protection**
"Think about it this way - if your roof fails in a storm while you're saving:
- You need $5,000-10,000 immediately for emergency repairs
- That drains your emergency fund
- You still need a new roof
- Insurance may deny claim (neglected maintenance)

With financing:
- Your emergency fund stays intact
- You're protected starting day 1
- Fixed monthly payment you can budget
- No surprise expenses"

### Objection 5: "I want to do it myself / Use my handyman"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Don't Discourage**
"I appreciate the DIY spirit! Roofing is definitely something people attempt."

**Step 2: Educate on Complexity**
"Before you commit to DIY, here's what's involved:

**Physical Requirements:**
- 20-40 hours of labor (for average home)
- Heavy lifting (80 lb bundles, 3-4 stories high)
- Heat exhaustion risk (roof temps reach 150°F)
- Fall risk (roofing is #1 construction injury)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Proper ventilation calculations (most DIY roofs fail here)
- Flashing techniques (chimneys, skylights, walls, valleys)
- Ice & water shield placement (code requirements)
- Manufacturer installation specs (void warranty if wrong)
- Local building codes and permit requirements

**Equipment Needed:**
- Roofing nailer ($200-500)
- Air compressor ($300-600)
- Safety harness ($200-400)
- Ladders and scaffolding ($500-1,000)
- Dumpster rental ($400-800)
- Magnetic nail sweeper ($100)
- **Total:** $1,700-3,700 (more if you buy instead of rent)"

**Step 3: Warranty Implications**
"Here's the biggest issue with DIY:

**DIY Roof:**
- No workmanship warranty
- Manufacturer warranty may be void (improper installation)
- Insurance may deny future claims (unpermitted/unlicensed work)
- Home sale issues (buyers want professional installation)
- Personal liability if someone gets hurt

**Professional Installation:**
- 24-month workmanship warranty
- GAF Lifetime System warranty (materials + installation)
- Insurance company approved
- Increases home value (vs decreases with DIY)
- Licensed, insured, bonded protection"

**Step 4: Cost-Benefit Analysis**
"Let's compare:

**DIY Cost:**
- Materials: $8,000-10,000 (no contractor discount)
- Equipment rental: $1,700-3,700
- Dumpster: $400-800
- Permits: $150-400
- Your time: 40 hours @ $50/hr = $2,000 (opportunity cost)
- **Total: $12,250-16,900**
- Result: No warranty, possible code violations, safety risk

**Professional Cost:**
- Complete installation: $15,000
- GAF Lifetime warranty included
- Licensed, insured crew
- Permit handling
- 1-2 day completion (vs your 5-7 days)
- **Total: $15,000**
- Result: Warrantied, code-compliant, insured

You save $1,000-2,000 by going pro, get a warranty, avoid injury risk, and save 40 hours of brutal labor."

**Step 5: Handyman Alternative**
"If you're using a handyman to save money, be aware:
- Most handymen aren't licensed for roofing
- No insurance = liability falls on you
- Can't offer manufacturer warranties (not certified)
- Permits may be denied (unlicensed contractor)
- No recourse if they do poor work

I've seen $8,000 handyman roofs need $15,000 professional re-do within 2 years. Save your handyman for smaller projects."

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The "Assumptive Schedule"
Don't ask IF they want to schedule. Ask WHEN:
- "Does Tuesday the 15th or Thursday the 17th work better for installation?"
- "Morning start (7am) or afternoon start (1pm)?"

### Technique 2: The "Limited Availability" Close
"I have 2 slots left this month. One is [date 1], one is [date 2]. Which works better for you?"

Creates urgency + forces decision.

### Technique 3: The "Puppy Dog" Close
"What if I get you approved for financing right now - no commitment? You can see exactly what your payment would be. Then you have all the information to make the best decision. Sound fair?"

Gets them to say "yes" to small commitment, builds momentum.

## State-Specific Timing Arguments

### Maryland
"Maryland's insurance law works in your favor RIGHT NOW. If you wait 6 months and your shingles are discontinued, you lose the matching argument. Insurance can claim your delay waived your rights. Act now while the law is on your side."

### Virginia
"Virginia doesn't have matching requirements, so we need to document repairability NOW. If you wait and your roof degrades further, insurance can claim it's wear-and-tear, not storm damage. Time-sensitive documentation is critical."

### Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania townships are cracking down on old roof permits. If you wait and codes change, you might be required to upgrade to 50-year systems or add expensive ice barriers. Lock in current code requirements now."

---

**Remember:** Timing objections are about fear of commitment. Remove friction, add urgency, make it easy to say yes NOW.
