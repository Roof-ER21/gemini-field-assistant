## Building Trust & Overcoming Skepticism

### Objection 1: "I've never heard of your company"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge Legitimately**

### Objection 2: "I've had bad experiences with contractors before"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Empathize Deeply**
"I'm sorry you had a bad experience. Unfortunately, there are contractors who give our industry a bad name, and I understand your hesitation."

**Step 2: Ask Discovery Questions**
"Can I ask - what happened in your previous experience?
- Did they disappear mid-project?
- Poor quality work?
- Unexpected charges?
- Damage to your property?
- Communication issues?

Knowing what went wrong helps me show you how we're different."

**Step 3: Address Specific Concerns**

**If they say: "Contractor disappeared"**
"Here's our accountability structure:
- Written contract with timeline and milestones
- Daily project manager communication
- You have owner's cell phone (not just office line)
- Online project portal (track progress in real-time)
- Payment schedule tied to completion (never pay ahead)
- Bonded ($XXX,000) - if we fail, you're financially protected"

**If they say: "Poor quality / Needed redoing"**
"Here's our quality guarantee:
- GAF Master Elite = proven quality standards
- Third-party inspections (not just our word)
- Photos/documentation at every stage
- 24-month workmanship warranty
- GAF Lifetime System warranty covers installation defects

**If they say: "Unexpected charges / Price changed"**

- Written proposal with EVERY line item
- No hidden fees, no surprises
- Price locked for 30 days
- Change orders require YOUR written approval
- You approve ANY extra work before we do it
- Final invoice matches proposal (or we eat the difference)"

**If they say: "Property damage / Messy"**
"Here's our property protection:
- Tarps protect landscaping, driveway, pool
- Magnetic sweeper (removes 99% of nails)
- Daily cleanup (not just end of project)
- $2M liability insurance (covers damage if it happens)
- Before/after photos (proves no damage)
- Restoration clause in contract (we fix any damage immediately)"

**Step 4: Provide Proof**
"I don't want you to just take my word. Here's what I can show you:
- References who had similar concerns

- Sample contract (review before committing)
- Insurance certificates (proof of coverage)
- License verification (state licensing board)

What would make you feel most confident?"

### Objection 3: "I don't trust salespeople / You're just trying to sell me"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge & Reframe**
"I totally get it. You've probably dealt with high-pressure sales tactics before."

**Step 2: Establish Different Approach**
"Here's my philosophy - I'm not here to 'sell' you. I'm here to:
1. **Educate** you on your options
2. **Show** you what's actually wrong (roof inspection)
3. **Explain** what insurance will/won't cover
4. **Provide** a fair price for quality work
5. **Let YOU decide** what makes sense

If a new roof doesn't make sense for you right now - I'll tell you. If repairs are a better option - I'll tell you. My job is to give you the information to make the best decision for YOUR situation."

**Step 3: Consultative Selling**
"Let me ask you some questions to understand what YOU need:
- What brought me out here today? (Leak, storm damage, age?)
- What are your biggest concerns about your roof?
- How long do you plan to stay in this home?
- Have you filed an insurance claim or are you paying out of pocket?
- What's most important to you - lowest price, best warranty, fastest installation?

[LISTEN TO ANSWERS - Don't interrupt]

Based on what you're telling me, here's what I recommend... [Tailored solution]"

**Step 4: No-Pressure Guarantee**
"Here's my promise:
- I won't pressure you to decide today
- I'll give you a written proposal to review
- I'll answer every question honestly
- If I don't know something, I'll find out (and get back to you)
- You can call me anytime - I'll always take your call
- If you say no, I'll respect that (and won't keep calling)

My goal is to earn your business by being helpful, not pushy. Deal?"

### Objection 4: "Your company is too big / too corporate"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Understand the Concern**
"I hear you. You're worried about being just a number, not getting personalized service. Am I understanding that right?"

**Step 2: Explain the Benefits of Size**
"Here's why our size actually works in YOUR favor:

**Better Resources:**
- We stock materials (no 4-week lead times)
- Multiple crews (faster scheduling)
- Dedicated project managers (you have a single point of contact)
- In-house admin (billing, insurance coordination, permits)
- Equipment fleet (no equipment breakdowns delaying your job)

**Financial Stability:**
- We've been in business [X] years (won't go bankrupt mid-project)
- Insurance claims properly handled (we have infrastructure)
- Warranty honored for life (small companies close, we won't)
- Bank accounts for deposits (legally protected, not personal accounts)

**Consistent Quality:**
- Standardized training (every crew follows same process)
- Quality control inspections (not just relying on one guy's skills)
- Backup crews available (if primary crew has emergency)
- Systems and procedures (not making it up as we go)"

**Step 3: Provide Personal Touch**
"But here's the personal service you'll get:
- [Your Name] is YOUR dedicated rep (I answer my cell 7am-9pm)
- [Project Manager Name] will visit your job daily
- [Owner Name] reviews every project (and his cell is on your contract)
- Small-company attitude, big-company capabilities

You get the reliability of a large company with the attention of a small company."

### Objection 5: "Your company is too small / unknown"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Reframe as Advantage**
"You're right - we're not a national chain. And here's why that's actually better for you:"

**Step 2: Local Business Benefits**
"As a local business:
- I live here (my reputation is everything)
- We answer to YOU, not corporate headquarters
- Decisions made locally (no waiting for corporate approval)
- Flexible and responsive (can accommodate your needs)
- Community invested (we're your neighbors)

**Proof of Stability:**
- Licensed & insured (verified by state)
- Bonded ($XXX,000 protection)
- GAF Master Elite (only 3% of contractors qualify - we're vetted)
- BBB A+ rating
- [X] years in business
- [X] satisfied customers
- $XXX,XXX in completed projects last year"

**Step 3: National Backing**
"While we're locally owned, we have national support:
- GAF (largest roofing manufacturer) backs our work
- GAF Lifetime System Warranty (honored nationwide)
- If something happened to us, GAF would still honor warranty
- Backed by billion-dollar company's reputation

You get local service with national protection."

## Overcoming the "I've Been Burned Before" Customer

This is the hardest customer - they've lost money and trust. Here's the approach:

1. **Validate their experience:**
   "I'm genuinely sorry that happened. No one should go through that."

2. **Don't bash the other contractor:**
   "I don't know what happened with them, but I can show you how we're different."

3. **Provide verifiable proof:**
   - License lookup (state website)
   - Insurance certificate (call agent to verify)
   - BBB report (live search)
   - References (call them now)

4. **Offer incremental trust:**
   "You don't have to trust me completely today. Let me earn it:
   - Review our contract with your attorney
   - Talk to 5 of our customers
   - Check our references
   - Meet our owner
   - Visit completed jobs

   Then decide. I'm not going anywhere."

5. **Payment protection:**
   "Here's how you're protected financially:
   - Small material deposit (10-20%)
   - No payment until work starts
   - No final payment until YOU approve
   - We're bonded - if we fail, you get your money back
   - You have all the leverage"

---

**Remember:** Trust is EARNED, not demanded. Show proof, be patient, honor your word, and deliver results. One satisfied customer creates 10 referrals - one burned customer destroys 50 potential sales.
