# Price & Cost Objections - Roof-ER Sales Responses

## Common Price Objections & Proven Responses

### Objection 1: "That's too expensive / More than I expected"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Empathize**
"I completely understand. A roof replacement is a significant investment, and you want to make sure you're making the right decision."

**Step 2: Reframe Value**
"Let me share why our pricing reflects the quality and protection you're getting. We're not just selling shingles - we're providing a complete roofing system with:"
- GAF Lifetime System Warranty (non-prorated, transferable)
- Storm damage coverage that other companies don't offer
- Professional installation by certified Master Elite installers
- 24-month workmanship warranty

**Step 3: Cost Breakdown**
"When you break down the investment over the life of the roof:
- 50-year warranty ÷ $15,000 = $300/year
- That's less than $1 per day for complete peace of mind
- Compare that to repair costs: $500-2,000 every 2-3 years"

**Step 4: Ask Discovery Questions**
- "What were you expecting to invest?"
- "Have you received other quotes? What did they include?"
- "What's most important to you - lowest price or best long-term value?"

### Objection 2: "I need to get other quotes / shop around"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Validate**
"Absolutely! I'd do the same thing. Getting multiple quotes is smart."

**Step 2: Educate on Comparison**
"When you're comparing quotes, make sure you're comparing apples to apples. Here's what to look for:

**Warranty Differences:**
- Are they offering GAF System Plus or Lifetime warranty?
- Is the warranty transferable if you sell your home?
- Does it cover materials AND labor?
- Is it non-prorated or does coverage decrease over time?

**Installation Quality:**
- Are they GAF Master Elite certified? (Only top 3% of contractors)
- Do they use ice & water shield in valleys?
- What's their ventilation strategy?
- Do they pull permits and pass inspections?

**Hidden Costs to Watch For:**
- Do they charge extra for tear-off?
- Are dump fees included?
- What about flashing, drip edge, ridge vents?
- Protection for landscaping and cleanup?"

**Step 3: Create Urgency (if applicable)**
"I completely support you getting other quotes. Just keep in mind:
- We have [limited availability this month]
- Storm damage claims have a time limit with insurance
- Material costs may increase [specific date]
- Our current promotion ends [date]"

**Step 4: Build Relationship**
"Even if you go with another company, I'm happy to review their quote with you to make sure you're getting everything you need. Can I follow up with you in [3-5 days] to answer any questions?"

### Objection 3: "Your price is higher than [Competitor]'s quote"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Don't Bash Competitors**
"I respect [Competitor] - they do good work in our area."

**Step 2: Differentiate Value**
"The price difference typically comes down to these factors:

**Our Approach Includes:**
1. **GAF Lifetime System Warranty** (Most competitors offer 10-15 year basic)
   - Covers materials, installation, algae, wind damage
   - Non-prorated (full coverage for life, not declining)
   - Transferable to new homeowner

2. **Master Elite Certification**
   - Only 3% of contractors qualify
   - Required annual training
   - Proven track record with GAF

3. **Storm Damage Advocacy**
   - We work WITH your insurance company
   - We document everything for claims
   - We handle supplements and negotiations

4. **Complete System Approach**
   - Ventilation analysis (most companies skip this)
   - Ice & water shield in critical areas
   - Proper flashing at chimneys, skylights, walls
   - Ridge venting for airflow

**Step 3: Ask for Their Quote**
"Do you have their quote with you? I'd be happy to review it and show you exactly where the differences are. Often I can explain line-by-line why our investment provides more long-term value."

**Step 4: ROI Comparison**
"Let's say their quote is $12,000 and ours is $15,000:
- If their roof fails in 10 years (limited warranty), you'll pay another $12,000
- Our Lifetime warranty means you're done - this is your last roof
- Over 30 years: Their approach = $24,000+ vs Our approach = $15,000
- Plus, our warranty increases your home value by $8,000-12,000"

### Objection 4: "I can't afford it right now / Don't have the money"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Empathize**
"I completely understand. A roof is a big expense, and timing matters."

**Step 2: Explore Financing**
"That's exactly why we offer financing options:
- **0% APR for 12 months** (if paid in full)
- **Low monthly payments** as low as $150/month
- **Same-day approval** for qualified applicants
- **No impact on credit** to get pre-approved

For a $15,000 roof:
- $1,250/month for 12 months (0% interest)
- $150/month for 10 years (6.99% APR)
- Compare to: Roof repairs every year ($500-2,000 each)"

**Step 3: Insurance Coverage**
"Also, have you filed an insurance claim? Most homeowners don't realize:
- Storm damage is often covered 100% by insurance
- You only pay your deductible ($500-2,500)
- We handle the entire claims process
- We can inspect for free to see if you qualify"

**Step 4: Cost of Delay**
"I understand the timing concern. What worries me is:
- Active leaks cause $5,000-15,000 in interior damage
- Mold remediation costs $2,000-10,000
- Delaying 6-12 months often doubles the repair scope
- Your insurance may deny future claims if you wait

Would it make sense to at least get approved for financing, so you have options if the situation gets worse?"

### Objection 5: "I'm just going to repair it / patch it for now"

**Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
"I understand wanting to take the most economical approach."

**Step 2: Cost Analysis**
"Let me show you why repairs often cost more in the long run:

**Repair Costs (Per Incident):**
- Small repair: $500-1,000
- Medium repair: $1,000-2,500
- Large repair: $2,500-5,000
- Frequency: Every 1-3 years on aging roofs

**5-Year Repair Scenario:**
- Year 1: $1,200 (leak over bedroom)
- Year 2: $800 (flashing repair)
- Year 3: $2,100 (storm damage)
- Year 4: $1,500 (another leak)
- Year 5: $3,000 (multiple areas failing)
- **Total: $8,600** + still need full replacement

**Replacement Scenario:**
- Year 1: $15,000 (one-time investment)
- Years 2-50: $0 (covered by warranty)
- **Total: $15,000** + peace of mind"

**Step 3: Insurance Implications**
"Here's what most homeowners don't know about repairs:
- Insurance companies track repair claims
- Multiple repair claims = higher premiums or dropped coverage
- After 2-3 claims, they may refuse to cover your roof
- Full replacement = single claim, then you're protected

If we do a full replacement now:
- One insurance claim (better than 3-5 repair claims)
- New Lifetime warranty protects future claims
- No more leak emergencies at 2am
- Your homeowner's insurance sees a brand new roof (lower premiums)"

**Step 4: Structural Damage Risk**
"My biggest concern with patching:
- Water damage spreads through decking and framing
- Mold grows in hidden areas (health hazard)
- Rot weakens the structure ($10,000-30,000 to fix)
- Interior damage ruins ceilings, insulation, belongings

A small leak today can become a $20,000 disaster in 6-12 months. Is it worth the risk to save $8,000 now but potentially spend $25,000 later?"

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The "Investment Calculator"
Show actual math:
- Cost per year of protection
- Avoided repair costs
- Home value increase
- Insurance savings over time

### Technique 2: The "Home Equity Approach"
"Your roof protects your single largest investment. If water damage reduces your home value by $20,000, saving $5,000 on a cheap roof just cost you $15,000 in equity."

### Technique 3: The "Future Sale Benefit"
"When you sell this home:
- Transferable Lifetime warranty = $8,000-12,000 premium
- Recent roof replacement = faster sale, better offers
- No inspection issues or buyer negotiations
- Return on investment: 60-80% of roof cost"

## State-Specific Price Arguments

### Maryland
"In Maryland, insurance companies are REQUIRED to account for matching (IRC R908.3). That means if 30% of your roof is damaged, they must cover 100% replacement because discontinued shingles can't match. This is your leverage - use it."

### Virginia
"Virginia doesn't require matching, so we need to focus on repairability arguments. I'll document that your shingles are brittle, won't seal properly, and pose a safety risk. This gets insurance to approve full replacement."

### Pennsylvania
"Pennsylvania townships often deny repair permits on roofs over 15 years old. We can use this to force insurance to approve full replacement. The permit denial is documented proof that repair isn't viable."

**Remember:** Price objections are rarely about price. They're about:
1. Perceived value (show ROI)
2. Trust (build credibility)
3. Fear (remove risk)
4. Urgency (create reason to act now)

Address the underlying concern, not just the stated objection.
