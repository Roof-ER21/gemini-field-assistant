Perfect — let’s run a sample workflow for a Partial Denial Siding Claim.

Here’s exactly how I’d guide you step by step in the field:

🏠 Scenario

Insurance approved 1 elevation of siding, but denied full replacement.

1️⃣ Immediate Response – Pick the Right Template

➡ Use the Siding Argument Template .

This doc has prebuilt arguments for:

Additional damage photos

Discontinued siding (via iTel & Discontinued List)

Code/Housewrap requirements (MD R703 or VA building code)

2️⃣ Supporting Evidence

📌 Discontinued Product

Check iTel report → If siding is discontinued, attach report.

Cross-reference with Discontinued Shingle/Siding list .

Argument: “Patch repair is impossible — only full replacement makes homeowner whole.”

📌 Code Requirement

Maryland: R703.2 requires continuous water-resistant barrier & housewrap, plus overlapping at corners .

This means siding removal inevitably damages adjacent panels, forcing full replacement.

Virginia: Code also supports no reinstallation of damaged siding panels .

3️⃣ Write the Pushback Email

Here’s a ready-to-use version (edit job details first):

Subject: Claim # [Insert] – Siding Scope Revision Request

To Whom It May Concern,

This is [REP NAME] with Roof-ER. I am assisting [CUSTOMER NAME].

Attached are:

Our photo report documenting additional siding damage,

An iTel report confirming the siding is discontinued,

Reference to building code R703, which requires full siding replacement for compliance.

Because the siding is discontinued and repairs would cause consequential damage, patch repair is not a cost-effective or code-compliant solution. The only way to restore [CUSTOMER NAME]’s property is full siding replacement on all elevations.

Please review these findings and provide a revised estimate accordingly. If additional inspection is required, I will gladly meet your adjuster on-site.

Thank you for your time and cooperation in restoring [CUSTOMER NAME]’s home.

[Signature & Contact Info]

4️⃣ Escalation if Denied Again

Have homeowner send the “Customer to Insurance” template .

If still stuck, file complaint with Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) citing Bulletin 18-23 on mismatch claims .

Last resort: consider arbitration .

✅ End Result: You’ve hit them with

Photo evidence,

Manufacturer & iTel data,

Code citations,

Homeowner involvement,

State insurance rules.

That’s the 5-layer defense that usually forces a scope revision.

clear picture of your Roof-ER job stages, based on the training deck you uploaded .

Here’s how they flow:

🔹

Job Stages & Timeline

Lead Generation / Door Knocking

Goal: 70 doors/day

Use pitch script (storm vs non-storm)

Pin houses in Field Portal

Inspection

Walk perimeter → note collateral damage (gutters, siding, downspouts, screens, etc.)

Get roof overview + chalk wind/hail hits

Take full photo set (portrait orientation for reports)

Safety: Cougar Paws, pitch hopper, bungees, etc.

Post-Inspection Pitch

Show photos of collateral first → build the “case”

Then show roof damage photos (hail = circles, wind = slashes)

Explain long-term damage (granule loss, leaks, deterioration)

Prep homeowner for claim filing

Claim Filing & Authorization

File claim with HO (use HO’s phone/app when possible)

Have HO sign Contingency Agreement (Roof-ER gets the job if fully approved)

Have HO sign Claim Authorization Form (allows you to communicate with insurance)

Adjuster Meeting (AM)

Happens 2–7 days after claim filed

Rep meets insurance adjuster on-site

Show collateral + roof damage, ensure adjuster sees everything

DOs: Show up early, chalk metals, build rapport, tactfully present case

DON’Ts: Be confrontational, take over inspection, or miss the meeting

Insurance Decision

Usually 1–10 business days after AM

Often partial or denial first time around

Rep must use templates (Photo Report, Repair Attempt, iTel, etc.) to push back

Project Meeting

Once full approval obtained → send estimate to Amber (estimates@theroofdocs.com)

Job assigned to Project Coordinator

PC meets with HO, signs Project Docs, and collects Downpayment (ACV check)

Install Scheduling

Usually 4–6 weeks after Downpayment

Coordinated via Trade Calendar

Install & Wrap Up

Roof installed

Quality Check + Wrap Up with HO

HO signs Certificate of Completion

Certificate sent to insurance → triggers depreciation release

Final Payment

HO pays deductible + depreciation funds
