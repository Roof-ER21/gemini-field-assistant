Re: 
Clarification of Bulletin No. 97-1: Coverage of Aluminum Siding Claims, 
Including Claims for Mismatch 
 
************************************************************************************* 
 
The purpose of this Bulletin is to update Bulletin No. 97-1 to take into consideration 
policy language that was not in existence at that time concerning an insurer’s obligation for a 
claim to replace damaged aluminum siding, which results in a mismatch in color shade, texture, 
or dimension.  
 
In 1997, the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) issued Bulletin No. 97-1 
regarding claims to replace aluminum siding due to damage caused by a covered peril under a 
“replacement cost” homeowners insurance policy. The Bulletin noted that replacement of 
damaged siding with new siding may result in a mismatch between existing siding and newly 
installed siding due to color shade, texture or dimension. Bulletin No. 97-1 advised that if a 
mismatch occurs, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other less visible 
areas of the house to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged 
siding on one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or a monetary allowance to 
reflect diminution in value of the house caused by mismatch. Bulletin No. 97-1 also noted that 
the law does not require a replacement cost policy to ensure in every instance the replacement of 
all siding, including undamaged siding, in order to eliminate or minimize mismatching. At the 
same time, the MIA advised that insurers whose settlement practices failed to take into account 
major differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions would be subject to 
administrative action under Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, which has been recodified as 
present Title 27, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article. 
 
At the time MIA Bulletin No. 97-1 was issued, policy language typically provided 
coverage for direct physical damage not otherwise excluded in the policy. Since the issuance of 
Bulletin 97-1 in 1997, however, most insurance policies now contain policy language 
specifically excluding mismatch claims. Terms, conditions and exclusions with respect to 
mismatch vary among insurers and policies. Moreover, the specific language of the individual 
insurance policy governs the rights, duties and obligations of the insurer and the policyholder.

In the absence of specific policy exclusion for mismatch claims, the advice contained in 
Bulletin 97-1 still applies. Mismatch exclusions may apply to aluminum siding claims as well as 
other exterior finish materials such as roofing. 
 
While most policies now contain a specific exclusion for mismatch claims, some insurers 
also offer optional coverage for mismatch claims. This coverage is not generally automatically 
included within a homeowners policy, but may be purchased at an additional cost. The terms, 
conditions and cost of such optional mismatch coverage vary among insurers and policies. To 
find out whether your insurer offers additional coverage for mismatch claims, Maryland 
consumers are encouraged to contact their producer or insurer for further information.
