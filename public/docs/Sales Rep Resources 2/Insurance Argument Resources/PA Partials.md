PA Partials


Update on Permit Status


We recently applied for a permit to replace the aluminum siding on the affected elevation. However,

the Township has denied the permit, citing that a full replacement is required to meet local building

codes.


We have attached a copy of the denied permit to this email. As you can see, the Township is

requiring a full replacement to ensure compliance with local regulations.


In light of this new information, we kindly request that you reconsider the estimate and update it to

include the full replacement costs. We believe that this is necessary to ensure that the repairs are

done correctly and in compliance with local building codes.


Please let us know if you need any additional information from us to facilitate this request.


Thank you for your attention to this matter.


Best regards,


[Your Name]

By using the denied permit as evidence, you can increase the chances of getting a full approval from

the insurance company.



This is the last step for PA partials once everything else is tried.
