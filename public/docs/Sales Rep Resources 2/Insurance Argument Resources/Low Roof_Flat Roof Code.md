# Low Roof_Flat Roof Code

Notes: Per Virginia Residential Building Code R905.2.2 - Slope: "Asphalt shingles shall be used only on roof slopes of two units vertical in 12 units horizontal (17-percent slope) or greater."

The Rear slope approved for replacement has Steepness Pitch of 1/12; Therefore Flat/Rubber/TPO roofing must be installed to be compliant with State Building Code

You can just copy and paste what is above (and edit the pitch of course) and send that to your adjuster, or have your customer send that to the adjuster
