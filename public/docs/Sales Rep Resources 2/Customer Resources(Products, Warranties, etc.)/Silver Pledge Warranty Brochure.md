When you install a qualifying GAF shingle, 
the basic GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited 
Warranty provides a Lifetime* limited warranty 
term for the shingles. And when you install a 
qualifying GAF shingle with at least 3 qualifying 
accessory products, you are automatically 
covered by the GAF Rooﬁng System Limited* 
Warranty, which also provides Lifetime* 
coverage for your qualifying accessory 
products! “Lifetime” means as long as the 
original owner(s) [or the second owner(s) in 
certain circumstances] owns the single-family 
detached residence where the shingles and 
qualifying accessories are installed.
The Lifetime* warranty term also comes with 
10 years of 100% coverage, during which 
GAF will provide any replacement GAF 
products necessary to repair your roof due 
to a manufacturing defect. GAF will also pay 
the reasonable cost to install them.* This 
warranty is also transferable, once, to the next 
homeowner, for free.
With the GAF Rooﬁng System Limited Warranty, 
after ten years, replacement materials and 
installation labor are prorated. 
Protect your home with our  
Silver Pledge
™ Limited  
Warranty! 
The Silver Pledge™ Limited Warranty 
increases the 100% coverage period against 
manufacturing defects from 10 years to 50 
years. It also covers tear-off and disposal costs.
Best of all, it provides 10 years of coverage 
against errors in the application of your GAF 
Shingles & Accessories and Covered Flashings 
that might have been made during the 
installation of your roof.
* See GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited Warranty and GAF Roofing System Limited Warranty for complete 
coverage and restrictions. See gaf.com/LRS for a list of qualifying shingles and accessory products.

It’s more 
than a 
warranty–  
it’s a burst of 
confidence
We can’t help with stage fright or your 
poker face, but we can help you feel more 
conﬁdent in your decisions, knowing your 
new roof is protected by a Silver Pledge™ 
Limited Warranty backed by GAF, North 
America’s largest rooﬁng manufacturer.

Contractors enrolled in GAF certification programs are not employees or agents of GAF, and GAF does not 
control or otherwise supervise these independent businesses. Contractors may receive benefits, such as 
loyalty rewards points and discounts on marketing tools from GAF for participating in the program.
   
1Applies in states/provinces/territories where all roofing contractors are required to be licensed.   
It’s a  
matter  
of trust
Installing a new roof is a big responsibility. But 
you can feel great about putting your project 
into the qualiﬁed hands of a factory-certiﬁed 
GAF Master Elite® Rooﬁng Contractor. 
Less than 2% of rooﬁng contractors can wear 
the GAF Master Elite® badge. It’s a status that 
can’t be bought — it has to be earned. Every 
GAF Master Elite® Rooﬁng Contractor must 
show that they are insured; licensed by their 
state, province, or territory;1 properly trained 
to install GAF products; and established 
in their local community with a history of 
installing roofs. As a result, more than 90% of 
property owners surveyed would recommend 
their GAF Master Elite® Contractor to others.2
2Based on a GAF survey of 18,020 property owners served by GAF Master Elite® Contractors from 
January 2019 to July 2020.

It’s a system, 
built to  
protect
The GAF Lifetime Roofing 
System has earned the  
prestigious Good Housekeeping 
Seal (applicable in U.S. only).
*  Lifetime refers to the length of warranty coverage provided and means as long as the original individual owner(s) of a single-family detached residence [or eligible second owner(s)] owns the property where the qualifying GAF products are installed. 
For other owners/structures, Lifetime coverage is not applicable. Lifetime coverage on shingles requires use of GAF Lifetime shingles only. See GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited Warranty for complete coverage and restrictions. Lifetime coverage on 
shingles and accessories requires use of any GAF Lifetime Shingle and any 3 qualifying GAF accessories. See GAF Roofing System Limited Warranty for complete coverage and restrictions. Visit gaf.com/LRS for qualifying GAF products.

1.  You MUST install a full roof; roofs installed on 
portions of buildings (such as half a roof on a 
duplex structure) do not qualify.
2.  Your roof MUST be installed by a GAF Master Elite® 
Rooﬁng Contractor.
3.  The roof system must NOT be installed over an 
existing roof — all existing materials must be 
removed to the deck. 
4.  If a new nail base insulated deck system is being 
installed, you must install GAF ThermaCal® 
Ventilated Nail Base Roof Insulation (covered by 
the ThermaCal® Nail Base Roof Insulation Panels 
Limited Warranty).
5.  In addition to eligible GAF Rooﬁng Shingles (visit 
gaf.com/LRS for eligible products), you MUST use 
one item from at least four of the following ﬁve 
accessory product categories:
 
(a)  GAF Roof Deck Protection (visit gaf.com/
LRS for eligible products). Note: If eligible 
products are not available, you may substitute 
any #30 ASTM D4869 felt or any #15 or #30 
ASTM D226 felt, but it will NOT count towards 
one of the four required accessory product 
categories.
 
(b)  GAF Leak Barrier in valleys and around dormers, 
side walls, ﬁrewalls, chimneys, plumbing vents, 
and skylights (visit gaf.com/LRS for eligible 
products). In addition, in the North (see map), 
an eligible Leak Barrier product must also be 
used at all eaves to at least 24" (60.96 cm) 
inside of the warm wall. Leak Barrier is highly 
recommended (but not required) at all roof 
rakes and other vulnerable leak areas.
 
(c)  GAF pre-cut Starter Strip Shingles (only those 
with factory-applied adhesive) at the eaves  
(visit gaf.com/LRS for eligible products).  
Note: Your GAF LayerLock-labeled Shingles will 
be covered up to the maximum wind speed 
ONLY if installed using 4 nails per shingle and 
you have GAF Starter Strip Products installed 
at the eaves and rakes. All other GAF Shingles 
require use of 6 nails per shingle and GAF 
Starter Strip Products installed at the eaves  
and rakes.
 
(d)  GAF Attic Ventilation Product installed in  
a properly balanced attic ventilation system 
consisting of both intake and exhaust 
ventilation (visit gaf.com/LRS for eligible 
products). Note: Although Master Flow® Attic 
Exhaust Vents count as an eligible accessory 
product in the GAF Attic Ventilation Category, 
they are covered by either the Master Flow® 
Powered Ventilation Products Limited Warranty 
or Master Flow® Ventilation Products Limited 
Warranty, depending on the product.
 
(e)  GAF Ridge Cap Shingles (visit gaf.com/LRS  
for eligible products) or shingles that 
correspond to the shingle product you  
are installing, as follows:
  
6.  For maximum weather protection, the use of GAF-
labeled Ultimate Pipe Flashing® at all plumbing 
vents is highly recommended (but not required). 
Ultimate Pipe Flashing® will be covered under the 
Silver Pledge™ Limited Warranty but will not fulﬁll  
a required accessory product category. 
7.  New metal ﬂashing(s) MUST be installed (unless 
existing ﬂashing(s) are in like-new condition or are 
at “unworkable” wall interfaces).  Metal drip edge 
MUST be used at eaves and is recommended  
(but not required) at rake edges. 
In addition to the requirements listed above, your 
Contractor must register and pay for your warranty 
within 45 days after installation. The warranty can  
be registered online at the GAF Contractor Zone  
(visit ccz.gaf.com). If your Contractor has not 
registered your warranty within 45 days after 
installation, GAF reserves the right not to issue  
your Silver Pledge™ Limited Warranty.
Note: GAF reserves the right to withhold the warranty 
if the roof has not been installed according to GAF 
published application instructions.
