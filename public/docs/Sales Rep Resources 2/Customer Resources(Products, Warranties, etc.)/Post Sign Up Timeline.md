# Post Sign Up Timeline

Insurance Process Steps & Timeline

*** Please note that every insurance company/ individual adjuster has slightly different timeline based on multiple variables. Below is what we can typically expect:

Step 1: Schedule Adjuster Meeting

Assigned insurance adjuster will reach out within 1-3 business days to schedule their inspection of your property

If you have interior or would like to make sure you are home for the inspection, please schedule and let me know so I can fit it into my calendar

Otherwise, please have the adjuster call me directly to schedule

THE most important part to me helping you get fully approved… is that I am here for the insurance company’s inspection.

Step 2: Adjuster Meeting

This meeting will typically be scheduled within 1-2 weeks of filing the claim varying based on the adjuster’s current work load.

I will arrive 30 minutes prior to the scheduled adjuster meeting time to set up my ladder.

After the inspection, we will knock on your door to recap our inspection and to communicate the next steps. If you are not home, I will call you to let you know how things went.

Step 3: Approved Scope of Work

Within 5 business days, the insurance company will provide an itemized estimate of the approved scope of work.

If we have not received anything within a week of the adjuster meeting, we will begin following up with you and the insurance company directly

Once you have received their written documentation please email that directly to myself and estimates@theroofdocs.com
