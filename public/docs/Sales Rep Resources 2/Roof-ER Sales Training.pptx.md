Initial Pitch
▪“Hi, how are you? My Name is ________ with Roof- ER 
we’re a local roofing company that specializes in 
helping homeowners get their roof replaced, paid for 
by their insurance!”  
▪Generic:
▪“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern 
Virginia/Central Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over 
the past few months that have done a lot of damage! 
▪“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve 
been able to help them get fully approved through their 
insurance company to have their roof  replaced.”

## Page 6

Initial Pitch
▪“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely 
free inspection to see if you have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do,  
I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest of the process. 
If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste 
mine! I will at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good 
shape.”
▪Pause here – Wait for them to respond/agree.
▪Once they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me 
about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m gonna take a look around the perimeter of 
your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your roof.
▪Go in for a handshake. “What was your name again? [Their name] great 
to meet you, again I am (your name).  Oh and by the way do you know 
who your insurance company is”? Wait for their answer, “Great! We work 
with those guys all the time.”
▪“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I 
will give you a knock when I finish up and show you what I’ve found.”
▪Without any hesitation, move into inspection. (See Inspection and 
Post-Inspection Script for detailed next steps.)

The Sales 
Cycle:
Adjuster 
Meeting
▪Adjuster meeting typically happens within 2 – 7 days
▪You meet with the insurance adjuster
▪You will also be creating your formal photo report this 
day
▪The decision from the insurance company usually 
comes within 1 – 10 business days
▪Once a decision is made, they usually only send the 
estimate to the homeowner
▪Ensure the homeowner is prepped to send this to you if 
the insurance company does not send it to you
▪Don’t worry – we will review this in much more detail 
later – we just want to ensure you understand the 
timeline at this point

## Page 24

The Sales 
Cycle:
Project 
Meeting
▪After you send the estimate to Amber 
(estimates@theroofdocs.com) and to me, we will begin to 
review the estimate and conduct what is called a Project 
Review
▪Within a few days, the job will be assigned to one of our 
Project Coordinators who will schedule a Project Meeting 
with your homeowner
▪This typically happens within a week of receiving the 
estimate
▪After that meeting, the homeowner will sign the Project 
Documents and submit Downpayment.
▪The Downpayment will typically be the first payment the 
insurance company sends. This payment is called Actual 
Cash Value (ACV)
▪You receive $1,000 of the job at Downpayment.

## Page 25

The Sales 
Cycle:
Install and 
Final Payment
▪The install will typically be scheduled in 4 – 6 weeks from 
the time that the Homeowner submits Downpayment
▪After the install is complete, we will schedule a Quality 
Check and Wrap Up with the homeowner. 
▪They will sign the Certificate of Completion here and we will 
submit this to the insurance company
▪The insurance company will then release the remaining 
funds.  They call this payment Depreciation.
▪The Homeowner then submits Final Payment.  This payment 
is a combination of the Depreciation plus their insurance 
deductible.
▪Once they submit Final Payment, you will receive the 
remaining 16% of the job.
▪The first 6 weeks, you get 16% of all completed jobs. After that, 
you have to qualify to get the max of 16%.

Entire inspection shouldn’t take any longer than 15-20 minutes. How thorough of an 
inspection you  should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is 
most important. It doesn’t  matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you 
don’t have enough damage-photos for  the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim. 
▪

## Page 33

Post-Inspection 
Pitch
▪Knock on the door 
▪“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. 
First I walked around the perimeter of the house  to look 
for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral 
damage we found on the roof.” Say this while going 
through house number and overview photos 
▪Start showing the pictures of damage to screens, 
gutters, downspouts, and soft metals
▪“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really 
helps build a story.  Think of us like lawyers and this 
collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case 
which helps us get the roof approved.”
▪Continue to slide through collateral damage photos

## Page 34

Post-Inspection 
Pitch
▪“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. 
Anything I have circled means its hail damage
▪Remain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the 
following
▪“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail 
damage. If you notice, the divot is circular  in nature.   Even if 
this  damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over 
time, these hail divots fill with water, freeze….,  when water 
freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle which will 
eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance 
company is responsible and your policy covers this type of 
damage.” 
▪Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. 
▪“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  
▪Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.

## Page 35

Post-Inspection 
Pitch
▪Now show them pictures of the granules in gutters and 
downspouts
▪“As you can see here, granules have filled up your 
gutters. These granules are supposed to be what’s 
protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your 
roof, it knocks out these granules which reduces the 
lifespan of your roof.”
▪Put phone away
▪“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home 
and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in the 
area”.

## Page 36

Post-Inspection 
Pitch
▪“With that being said, insurance companies are always 
looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s unfortunate 
but that’s how they make money. The most important 
part of this process is that when your insurance 
company comes out to run their inspection, we are here 
as storm experts to make sure you as a homeowner get 
a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure 
they see all the damage that I  just showed you.” 
▪“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my 
iPad and we can get this process started”! Go get iPad 
▪As you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is 
there a place we could sit down for 5-10  Minutes”?
▪Once you are in the house, spend some time building 
rapport as you get settled.

## Page 37

Post-Inspection 
Pitch
▪“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our 
system. Then we can let your insurance company know about the 
damage”. 
▪Gather information from the homeowner:
▪
Full name
▪
Address
▪
Phone Number  
▪
E-mail
▪
Insurance Company
▪“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”! 
▪After you have collected all the information:
▪Ask if they have the app or if they have the login to the website. 
▪If not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO.  As you are 
writing or typing the information for the HO to use on the call, explain 
each part to them.
▪As much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call 
▪Reference Claim Filing Information Sheet
▪Move on to Contingency & Claim Authorization

## Page 38

Post-Inspection 
Pitch:
Additional lines 
if wind damage 
is present
▪“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. 
Anything I have circled means its hail damage and  
anything I have slashed means its wind damage.”
▪After you go through the lines explaining the hail 
damage, say:
▪“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have 
(both,) shingles that are creased from the wind lifting 
them up (and shingles that have completely been blown 
off.”)
▪Show the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing 
shingles

## Page 39

Post

Pitch
▪Break into groups
▪Read through Post Inspection Pitch with Hail Damage a

Authorization 
Script
▪This is where you really go for the close
▪After filing the claim: “Okay, perfect! Like they said, an 
adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24 to 48 
hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most 
important part of this process is that I am at this 
inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. 
They are trying to mitigate their losses after storms. I 
am there as your representation to make sure you get a 
fair shake.”
▪Turn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see.

## Page 52

Contingency & 
Claim 
Authorization 
Script
▪“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the 
homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost will 
be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a 
partial approval or denial, first we will fight and jump 
through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full 
approval; but if we are not able to get you fully 
approved, this contract is null and void and you do not 
owe us a penny.
▪“What’s in it for us, is we just want to get to do the work. 
This agreement commits you to using us if we hold up 
our end of the bargain and achieve a full-approval.”
▪You sign
▪They sign

company.  I’ll be here for the inspection and  we will 
also communicate with them through email and phone 
calls so you don’t have to be a middle-man.  Of course, 
I’ll always keep you looped in with our communication 
by CCing you in all emails and updating you on any 
conversations we have.”
▪They sign
▪Press Submit enter password “roofer” if it asks.

Contingency & 
Claim 
Authorization 
Script
▪“Alright, we are all set! Again, the most important part 
of this process is that I am here when the insurance 
company comes out.  Ideally you can have them call me 
to schedule that directly. If they call me, great! But, 
regardless, please get the adjuster’s information (name, 
email, phone number) and send that over to me so that I 
can communicate with them before the inspection. If 
they insist on scheduling with you, go ahead and pencil 
in a time and avoid these times and days [provide your 
schedule]
▪Answer any questions that the HO may have
▪“Thank you, sir/ma’am, looking forward to seeing you 
on the day of inspection, you have my contact 
information on my card if you need anything else.”

Mission and 
Values
Our Mission:
▪
At Roof-ER, our mission is to hold a fiduciary responsibility to our customers - plain and simple. 
In an industry known for poor workmanship, lack of communication, and at times, outright 
deceit; we seek to restore the name of exterior remodeling contractors nationwide. By 
committing to our core values of Integrity, Quality, and Simplicity, we promise to deliver an 
experience every homeowner wants when remodeling their home: a simple and straightforward 
quality installation for a fair and honest price.
Our Core Values:
▪
Integrity: At Roof-ER, we set the standard for Integrity in an industry that has lost credibility 
among many consumers. We do not only set the standard of integrity with our clients, but it 
starts with being honest to ourselves. We have the courage to truly see ourselves, recognize 
where we can grow, and implement changes to meet the demands of reality.
▪
Quality: We guarantee the highest Quality in our products and services.  Our confidence in our 
craft propels us into the elite 2% of all roofing companies in the entire nation. Quality starts with 
the moment a client interacts with one of our representatives at the door.  The Quality 
demonstrated in every aspect of what we do continues to make Roof-ER the gold standard of 
this industry.
▪
Simplicity: We strive to deliver an overwhelmingly positive experience for everyone who 
interacts with Roof-ER.  By embracing the complexities of our industry, we provide exceptional 
results to our clients.  Our clients value the Simplicity of partnering with us – we guarantee a 
seamless process from start to finish ensuring satisfaction with the final outcome.
