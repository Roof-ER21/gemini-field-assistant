Filming Repair Attempt Video
Before you begin filming, ask the Field Tech (Francisco or Ishmael) to point out which of the
surrounding shingles will be affected by the extraction. Mark the damaged tab (if applicable) and
mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.
Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle.
Start recording, state the Homeowners name and house number. “...Here we are at
[HOMEOWNER’S HOUSE at 1234 (street name)] performing a repair attempt on this storm
damaged shingle. As you can see I have pre-marked every tab that will sustain unavoidable
creasing due to the brittleness of the roof. Go ahead and get started Francisco/Ishmael”
Film the entire area where repair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low
down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process.
Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount of granule loss running down
the roof.
Once the new shingle has been installed, hover the camera over the shingles and wipe your hand
back and forth gently or blow over the top of each tab that was pried up. Trace your finger along the
crease and show it on camera, explain how each tab has now been mechanically creased and
confirms the roof failed a “brittle test”. (picture below)
Once you have finished recording your video. Take close-up after pictures of the rows above the
replaced shingle. Draw an arrow to where the crease is on the shingle or point to it for the picture.
(see good examples of after pics below email template)
To whom it may concern,
Please see the attached video link and photos of the attempted repair for the claim number
(#__________).
As can be clearly seen in the evidence provided, the homeowner's roof sustained additional
damage during the attempted repairs. Thus confirming a failed brittle test for the shingles, indicating
irreparability for the roof as a whole.
With this fact established, your current estimate does not adequately address the needs of this roof.
Performing further patch repairs as [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME] has suggested will
unintentionally, yet unavoidably, cause further extensive damage to surrounding shingles.
Therefore I have gone ahead and attached an estimate that accurately reflects the full scope of
work necessary to make our mutual client whole again.
YouTube Link: (watch this for a good example)
I also ask that you take note of the attached before and after pictures of the attempted repair. These
photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs
will inevitably do further unavoidable damage to surrounding shingles.
Please review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so we can begin
to move forward with the full roof replacement for [HOMEOWNER NAME]. If we can provide any
additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

When you need a Hover ESX, XML, or PDF to send to your adjuster, please task Brandon, Danny,
Ford, or Reese to approve your Hover. Please state in your task if it is roof only or roof and siding.
After the Hover is approved, you will receive an email from Hover with the PDF. Once you receive
that, it means your Hover is ready (if it is roof and siding, it will take a little bit longer to have the
siding added as well.)
Once the Hover is complete, you will be able to download your own ESX, XML, or PDF. You will
also be able to see if your Hover is still processing and not ready for download yet.
You will do this through your internet browser; this can be done on a computer, ipad, or on your
phone. Go to the website: Hover.to
Once you go there, search your customer’s Job ID to find your customer. See the screenshot
below. The Job ID is 6902
If you manually created the hover (which you should not be doing) you will have to just search for
the customer’s hover that you manually created.
Once you open the file, you will click “export”. See screenshot below
You will then download the ESX. See screenshot below
ESX is at the very bottom. Once you click that checkbox next to it, press download.
The most effective way to get this to your adjuster is to:
Email this file to yourself.
Download the document(s) on your computer, phone or iPad.
Compose a new email and send it to your adjuster. (This way you can write the subject, write the
note, and it should have your signature at the bottom of the email.)
