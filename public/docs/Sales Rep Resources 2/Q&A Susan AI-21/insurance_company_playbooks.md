# 1. STATE FARM

## Claim Handling Patterns

**Key Alert**: Oklahoma Attorney General investigation alleges State Farm operated a "Hail Focus Initiative" - an internal program to reduce roof claim payouts through systematic denials.

### Common Denial Tactics
- **Denial mindset in high-claim areas**: When many claims occur in an area, State Farm adopts a denial-first approach
- **"Deny and delay"**: Multiple denials before approval, sometimes taking years
- **Granular loss claims**: Adjusters trained to cite "natural weathering" for granular loss
- **Repairability focus**: Internal messaging shifted from replacement to repair-focused settlements
- **Low-ball offers**: Initial offers often far below repair costs (e.g., $1,400 on $22,000+ repairs)

### Depreciation Calculation
- Uses Actual Cash Value (ACV) calculations
- Aggressive depreciation on older roofs
- Recovery of depreciation requires completed work documentation

### Partial Approval Tendencies
- Approves partial repairs even when full replacement is warranted
- Pushes "repair rather than replace" narrative
- Often requires multiple inspections before full approval

## Documentation Preferences

### What State Farm Responds Best To
- Photos of all damaged items with clear measurements
- Contractor present at inspection to identify missed damage
- Written scope comparison (your estimate vs. adjuster's estimate)
- Code documentation for required items

### Preferred Formats
- Digital photo documentation with timestamps
- Xactimate-formatted estimates
- Manufacturer specifications for material requirements

### Re-inspection Triggers
- Contractor disagreement with initial assessment
- Discovery of additional damage
- Code compliance documentation showing required items

## Supplement Success Strategies

### What Works
- Detailed line-by-line Xactimate supplements
- Code compliance documentation (drip edge, ice/water shield)
- Manufacturer warranty requirements documentation
- Photos of hidden damage discovered during work
- Persistence - supplements often approved on 2nd or 3rd submission

### Common Supplement Denial Reasons
- "Not storm damage - normal wear and tear"
- "Granular loss is weathering, not hail"
- "Code upgrades not covered"
- "Repairs, not replacement, are sufficient"

### Timing That Works
- Submit supplements within 30 days of discovery
- Follow up every 7-10 days
- Request written denial reasons for appeals

## Adjuster Communication

### Effective Communication Style
- Professional and persistent
- Document all verbal communications in writing
- Request all denials in writing with specific reasons
- Ask for supervisor contact when adjuster is unresponsive

### Escalation Paths
1. Request reinspection with different adjuster
2. Ask about State Farm Premier Service Program eligibility
3. Request supervisor review
4. Invoke appraisal clause
5. File complaint with state insurance department

### Regional Variations
- Oklahoma: Heavy scrutiny due to AG investigation
- Texas: Strict on "worn roof" arguments
- Florida: Additional documentation requirements
- Colorado: Hail claims face intense review

## Contractor Experiences

### What Contractors Report
- "State Farm is never going to pay out on this" - common reaction from experienced contractors
- Approval-then-non-payment scenarios reported
- 3+ year claim resolution times not uncommon
- Multiple adjusters cycling through single claims

### Solutions That Work
- Have contractor present at every inspection
- Obtain independent engineering report for disputed claims
- Use appraisal process for significant underpayments
- Document everything in writing

- Estimates not aligned with Xactimate standards

## Supplement Success Strategies

### Submission Requirements
1. Add statement in XactAnalysis Notes explaining supplement
2. Include exact reason for each supplement item
3. Attach supporting photos for every line item
4. Match labor and material breakdown to USAA format

### What Gets Approved
- Items required by code with documentation
- Hidden damage with photo evidence

- **Roof Surface Payment Schedule**: Structured depreciation reduces payouts

### Depreciation Issues

# UNIVERSAL STRATEGIES FOR ALL INSURERS

## Xactimate Supplement Best Practices

### Commonly Overlooked Line Items
1. **Tear-off & disposal** - Include multiple layer removal
2. **Starter course shingles** - Different labor rate than field shingles
3. **Head wall/end wall flashing** - Often left out
4. **Valley lining** - Cannot usually be reused
5. **Ice and water shield** - Code compliance item
6. **Drip edges** - Manufacturer warranty requirement
7. **Ridge caps** - System component
8. **Overhead and Profit (O&P)** - Business operations compensation

### Documentation Requirements
- Attach photos, notes, code references to estimates
- Use Xactimate's built-in local pricing updates
- Create supporting evidence for each line item

## Code Upgrade Tactics

### Common Insurer Tactics
- Require documentation "impossible to get"
- Claim code "not enforced" without permit
- Deny items based on technicalities

### Counter Strategies
1. Cite specific code from local municipality
2. Obtain letter from building inspector
3. Get permit (triggers inspection enforcement)
4. Cite manufacturer warranty requirements

### Manufacturer Warranty Leverage
- GAF Timberline HD requires drip edge for basic warranty
- When manufacturer requires item, contractor must install
- Adjuster must pay regardless of local code

## Appraisal Process

### When to Invoke
- Both parties agree damage is covered but disagree on cost
- Insurance unwilling to negotiate to fair market value
- Significant underpayment (30%+ below fair value)

### Process
1. Submit Appraisal Demand Letter (ADL)
2. Homeowner hires independent appraiser
3. Insurance appoints their appraiser
4. Appraisers select umpire
5. Any two of three determine binding amount

### Important Notes
- Appraisal resolves amount disputes, not coverage disputes
- Usually faster and cheaper than lawsuits
- Contractors cannot negotiate for homeowners (PA license required)
- Contractors CAN provide documentation and estimates

## Adjuster Meeting Best Practices

### Before Meeting
- Show up early with ladder set up
- Manage homeowner expectations
- Be prepared for possibility of denial

### During Inspection
- "Kill with kindness" - reputation spreads in industry
- DON'T chalk the roof - photos may not be accepted
- DON'T point out damage directly - ask "What do you think of this?"
- Let adjuster feel in control
- Slow adjuster down to find all damage

### After Meeting
- Document everything in writing
- Follow up within 7 days
- Prepare supplement if items missed
