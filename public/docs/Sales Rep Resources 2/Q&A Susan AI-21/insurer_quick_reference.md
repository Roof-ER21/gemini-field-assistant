# STATE FARM

## Red Flags
- "Hail Focus Initiative" - systematic denial program under investigation
- Expect denial on first attempt
- "Deny and delay" pattern common

## Susan 21 Response Template

**When contractor says "My customer has State Farm":**

> State Farm has been aggressive with denials recently. Key strategies:
>
> 1. **Be present at inspection** - State Farm adjusters often miss damage
> 2. **Expect denial** - Don't be discouraged by first denial; many claims approved on 2nd or 3rd inspection
> 3. **Document everything** - Photos with measurements, code requirements
> 4. **Watch for granular loss excuse** - They claim it's "natural weathering" not hail
> 5. **Request reinspection** - Ask for different adjuster if denied
> 6. **Consider appraisal** - State Farm underpays significantly; appraisal recovers fair value

## Key Objection Responses

**State Farm says: "This is granular loss from weathering, not hail."**
> Per State Farm's own guidelines, excessive granular loss accompanying actual hail damage that affects roof integrity is covered. Document the hail impact marks, not just granular loss.

**State Farm says: "We'll repair, not replace."**
> Request the specific criteria used for repair vs. replacement decision. If damage exceeds manufacturer replacement thresholds, document and challenge.

# USAA

## Key Characteristic
- Military-focused, generally more cooperative
- Strict documentation requirements
- Uses PDRP (Property Direct Repair Program)

## Susan 21 Response Template

**When contractor says "My customer has USAA":**

> USAA is generally easier to work with than most carriers. Key requirements:
>
> 1. **Supplement documentation is critical** - Must include written explanation in XactAnalysis Notes or they auto-reject
> 2. **Photos must be labeled** - Good photographs with clear labeling are required
> 3. **Roof InSight available** - Free aerial measurements on most claims
> 4. **Customer has choice** - They don't have to use PDRP contractors
> 5. **Military-style communication** - Direct, professional, organized

## Key Objection Responses

**USAA rejects supplement without explanation:**
> USAA requires a statement in XactAnalysis Notes explaining exactly what the supplement is and why. Resubmit with detailed explanation for each line item.

# ALLSTATE

## Red Flags
- Multiple denials expected before approval
- Uses estimating software paying 30% below fair market
- "Roof Surfaces Extended Coverage" - check if purchased

## Susan 21 Response Template

**When contractor says "My customer has Allstate":**

> Allstate commonly denies claims multiple times before approval. Strategy:
>
> 1. **Never accept first denial** - Many claims approved on 2nd or 3rd inspection
> 2. **Check for Extended Coverage** - Ask if "Roof Surfaces Extended Coverage" is on policy; if not, expect heavy depreciation
> 3. **Expect 30% underpayment** - Their software pays below market; appraisal may recover 50-100% more
> 4. **Former adjusters report** - Coaching shifted from fair settlement to "repairability" focus
> 5. **Be prepared for appraisal** - Often the only way to get fair value

## Key Objection Responses

**Allstate says: "This is maintenance/pre-existing."**
> Provide detailed photographic evidence distinguishing storm damage from wear. Get independent contractor report directly addressing their denial reasons.

**Allstate offers low settlement:**
> Compare their estimate to your Xactimate scope. Their software underpays by 30%. Consider invoking appraisal for fair market value.

## Key Objection Responses

**Liberty Mutual says: "Damage is from installation error."**

> 6. **Consider legal consultation** - Bad faith claims have been successful

## Key Objection Responses

**Erie denies, then changes reason:**
> Document all communications. Shifting denial reasons suggest arbitrary decision-making. File complaint with state insurance department if pattern continues.

# UNIVERSAL SUPPLEMENT TIPS

## Commonly Missed Line Items
1. Starter course shingles (different labor rate)
2. Head wall/end wall flashing
3. Valley lining (cannot be reused)

## Appraisal Trigger Points
