# State-Specific Q&A for Susan 21 AI

## Contractor Boundaries - What We Can and Cannot Do

### Q401: Homeowner asks:
"Can you file my insurance claim for me?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
No - filing claims requires a public adjuster license in VA, MD, and PA.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
I cannot file your insurance claim. In Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, only licensed public adjusters can file claims, negotiate with insurance companies, or advise on coverage. As your contractor, I can prepare detailed estimates, document damage, attend adjuster meetings to provide technical information, and answer questions about repair methods. Filing the claim is something you or a licensed public adjuster must do.

### Q402: Homeowner asks:
"Can you negotiate with my insurance company?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
No - negotiating insurance claims is restricted to licensed public adjusters.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Negotiating with your insurance company on your behalf would require a public adjuster license. In Maryland, a contractor was fined $2,000 in 2023 for performing these acts without proper licensing. What I can do is provide detailed Xactimate estimates, document all damage with photos, explain technical requirements to the adjuster, and help you understand what the building codes require. You have the right to negotiate on your own behalf or hire a licensed public adjuster.

### Q403: Adjuster says:
"The contractor can't tell the homeowner what their policy covers."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Correct - coverage interpretation is between the insured and insurer.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

You are correct that I cannot advise the homeowner on policy coverage interpretation. That is between the policyholder and the insurance company or a licensed public adjuster. However, I can and will document what the building codes require, what manufacturer specifications demand, and what is needed for a proper repair. The homeowner can then discuss with you whether these items are covered under their specific policy language.

## Virginia-Specific Q&A

### Q404: Carrier says:
"Virginia doesn't mandate drip edge."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Manufacturer requirements make drip edge mandatory for warranty compliance.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

While the Virginia USBC doesn't prescriptively require drip edge, it does require compliance with manufacturer installation instructions. GAF, Owens Corning, and CertainTeed all require drip edge at eaves and rakes in their installation specifications. Installing without drip edge would void the manufacturer warranty and violate Virginia's requirement to follow manufacturer instructions.

**Citation:** VUSBC; GAF Installation Instructions

### Q405: Adjuster says:
"Code upgrades aren't enforced in Virginia because you don't need a permit for roof covering."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Permit for sheathing triggers full code inspection.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

While roof covering replacement alone may not require a permit in Virginia, sheathing replacement does require a permit. Once a permit is pulled for sheathing, all aspects of the job are inspected, and all building code requirements become enforceable. This job includes sheathing replacement, which requires a permit. Therefore, ice and water shield, proper underlayment, and all flashing requirements must be met and should be covered under Ordinance or Law coverage.

**Citation:** Virginia 13VAC5-63-80

### Q406: Carrier says:
"Virginia doesn't have ice dam requirements."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Virginia Residential Code R905.1.2 requires ice barrier in ice dam regions.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

You've stated Virginia doesn't require ice barrier. Per Virginia Residential Code R905.1.2, in areas where there has been a history of ice forming along eaves, an ice barrier must be installed. It must extend from the lowest roof edge to a point not less than 24 inches inside the exterior wall line. For steep slopes (8:12 or greater), it must extend 36 inches from the eave edge. This property is in an area with documented ice dam history.

**Citation:** Virginia Residential Code R905.1.2

### Q407: Homeowner asks:
"What if my insurance company acts in bad faith in Virginia?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
File complaint with Virginia Bureau of Insurance.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
If you believe your insurance company is acting unfairly or in bad faith, you have options. The Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance can investigate complaints and impose penalties on insurers who don't comply with state laws requiring fair claims handling. You can contact them at 1-877-310-6560, email AskAQuestion@scc.virginia.gov, or file online at scc.virginia.gov.

**Citation:** Virginia Code Title 38.2

### Q408: Carrier says:
"Existing flashings can be reused in Virginia."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Virginia Existing Building Code 908.5 requires replacement of deteriorated flashings.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

Per Virginia Existing Building Code Section 908.5, any existing flashings, edgings, outlets, vents or similar devices that are part of the roof assembly "shall be replaced where rusted, damaged or deteriorated." The existing flashings on this property show signs of deterioration and must be replaced per code.

**Citation:** Virginia Existing Building Code 908.5

## Maryland-Specific Q&A

### Q409: Carrier says:
"Maryland doesn't require matching on roofing."

**Short Answer (with source):**
MIA Bulletin 18-23 applies matching guidance to roofing materials.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

You've denied matching for roofing. Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 specifically states that mismatch guidance "may apply to aluminum siding claims as well as other exterior finish materials such as roofing." If the policy does not contain a specific mismatch exclusion, the original Bulletin 97-1 guidance applies, which includes options for full replacement when matching isn't possible.

**Citation:** MIA Bulletin 18-23 (October 30, 2018)

---

### Q410: Adjuster says:
"The contractor's insurance doesn't matter in Maryland."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Maryland requires $500,000 minimum liability insurance for MHIC contractors.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

Effective June 1, 2024, Maryland Code Business Regulation Article 8-302.1 requires all MHIC-licensed contractors to maintain minimum general liability insurance of $500,000. This is a condition for licensing. Roof-ER maintains full compliance with this requirement. Our Certificate of Insurance is available upon request.

**Citation:** MD Business Regulation Article 8-302.1

### Q411: Homeowner asks:
"Does Maryland require house wrap when replacing siding?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
Yes - Maryland R703 requires weather-resistive barrier.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Yes, Maryland building code R703 requires a weather-resistive barrier (house wrap) to be installed under all siding. This protects the structure from moisture intrusion. When we replace your siding, house wrap installation is code-required and should be included in your insurance claim if siding is being replaced due to a covered loss.

**Citation:** Maryland Building Code R703

---

### Q412: Carrier says:
"We'll pay for damaged panels only in Maryland."

**Short Answer (with source):**
If panels cannot be matched, full elevation replacement required per MIA guidance.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

You've limited coverage to damaged panels only. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 97-1 and 18-23, if siding cannot be reasonably matched in color, texture, or dimension, settlement options include replacement of both damaged and undamaged siding on one or more sides, or replacement of all siding. Partial panel replacement creating a visible mismatch fails to meet the "like kind and quality" standard.

**Citation:** MIA Bulletin 97-1, Bulletin 18-23

---

### Q413: Homeowner asks:
"What's the MHIC Guaranty Fund?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
Protection fund for losses from licensed contractor's poor work.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
The Maryland Home Improvement Commission Guaranty Fund protects homeowners who suffer losses from unworkmanlike, inadequate, incomplete, or abandoned work by MHIC-licensed contractors. It covers actual losses up to $30,000 per claimant. Claims must be filed within 3 years of discovering the loss, and the contractor must have been licensed at the time they performed the work. This is one reason why working with licensed contractors matters.

**Citation:** MHIC Guaranty Fund Regulations

### Q414: Carrier says:
"We don't owe for kickout flashing in Maryland siding repairs."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Kickout flashing required at roof-wall intersections by code.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

You've excluded kickout flashing from siding repairs. Per Maryland building code, kickout flashing is required at roof-wall intersections to divert water away from siding and prevent moisture intrusion into the wall assembly. Omitting kickout flashing during siding replacement violates code and leaves the structure vulnerable to water damage.

**Citation:** Maryland Building Code

## Pennsylvania-Specific Q&A

### Q415: Carrier says:
"Pennsylvania doesn't require contractor registration."

**Short Answer (with source):**
HICPA requires registration for contractors doing $5,000+ annually.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

The Pennsylvania Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act (Act 132 of 2008) requires all contractors performing $5,000 or more of home improvements annually to register with the Attorney General's Office. Unregistered contractors are prohibited from performing home improvements. Roof-ER is fully registered and compliant with HICPA requirements.

**Citation:** 73 P.S. 517.1 et seq. (HICPA)

### Q416: Homeowner asks:
"Do I need a permit for roof replacement in Pennsylvania?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
Most townships require permits for roof replacement.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Pennsylvania's Uniform Construction Code requires permits for roof replacement - it's considered an alteration, not ordinary repair. However, about 92% of Pennsylvania municipalities have their own enforcement, and requirements can vary. Some townships may exempt roof covering if no sheathing is replaced. We always verify local requirements before starting work. Permit costs in PA typically range from $50-$150 for single-family homes.

**Citation:** 34 Pa. Code Chapter 403

---

### Q417: Adjuster says:
"This township doesn't require permits for roofing."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Verify in writing - requirements vary by municipality.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

While some Pennsylvania townships have exemptions for certain roofing work, requirements vary significantly among the state's 2,500+ municipalities. If the local jurisdiction has confirmed in writing that no permit is required for this specific scope, we will document that. However, if the work includes sheathing replacement, a permit is required under the UCC. We recommend confirming directly with the local building code official.

**Citation:** 34 Pa. Code 403.42

### Q418: Carrier says:
"We're canceling this policy based on aerial imagery showing roof damage."

**Short Answer (with source):**
PA Insurance Dept. Notice 2024-06 requires more than aerial imagery.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Dear Homeowner,

The Pennsylvania Insurance Department issued Notice 2024-06 specifically addressing this practice. The Department found that aerial images showing discoloration, streaking, or cosmetic damage alone should NOT be used as the sole basis for policy cancellation or nonrenewal. Without unequivocal and material damage shown, insurers should conduct a physical inspection. You have the right to request a physical inspection and can file a complaint with the PA Insurance Department at 1-877-881-6388.

**Citation:** PA Insurance Department Notice 2024-06

---

### Q419: Homeowner asks:
"Can I cancel my contractor agreement in Pennsylvania?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
Yes - 3 business days to rescind per HICPA.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Under Pennsylvania's Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act, you have the right to rescind (cancel) any home improvement contract within three business days of signing, without penalty. This applies except in emergency situations as defined by law. This right must be stated in the contract. If you need to cancel, provide written notice to the contractor.

**Citation:** 73 P.S. 517.7 (HICPA)

### Q420: Carrier says:
"We'll use the pre-storm roof photos showing mismatched shingles."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Collins v. Allstate case - pre-existing mismatch affects claim.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Dear Homeowner,

In the Pennsylvania case Collins v. Allstate Ins. Co., the court found that pre-existing mismatched roof materials could affect matching claims. If your roof had uniform appearance before the storm damage, document that now with any photos you have. This establishes that the mismatch was caused by the storm damage, not a pre-existing condition. Pre-loss documentation of uniform appearance strengthens your position.

**Citation:** Collins v. Allstate Ins. Co. (E.D. Pa. 2010)

### Q421: Adjuster says:
"Pennsylvania doesn't require ice barrier."

**Short Answer (with source):**
IRC requires ice barrier at eaves in cold climates.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

Pennsylvania follows the International Residential Code, which requires ice barrier at eaves in regions prone to ice dams. This area of Pennsylvania has documented ice dam history. Per IRC Chapter 9, ice barrier must extend from the lowest roof edge to a point at least 24 inches inside the exterior wall line. Omitting ice barrier violates code and leaves the structure vulnerable to ice dam damage.

**Citation:** IRC R905.1.2 as adopted in PA UCC

---

### Q422: Homeowner asks:
"What if my contractor does fraudulent work in PA?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
HICPA creates criminal penalties for home improvement fraud.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Pennsylvania's Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act creates criminal penalties for home improvement fraud. This includes contractors who intentionally provide false information, receive payment but fail to provide services, damage property to solicit work, or alter contracts without consent. You can report unregistered or fraudulent contractors to the PA Attorney General's Home Improvement Registration Hotline at 1-888-520-6680.

**Citation:** 73 P.S. 517.8 (HICPA)

## Cross-State Comparison Q&A

### Q423: Homeowner asks:
"Which state has the strongest matching requirements?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
Maryland has most explicit guidance through MIA Bulletins.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Among Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, Maryland has the most explicit matching guidance through Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletins 97-1 and 18-23. These bulletins specifically address when full replacement is required due to matching issues. Virginia and Pennsylvania rely more on policy language and case law. However, in all three states, the specific policy language ultimately governs, so reviewing your policy for matching exclusions is essential.

**Citation:** MIA Bulletin 97-1, 18-23

---

### Q424: Homeowner asks:
"What's the difference in contractor licensing between these states?"

**Short Answer (with source):**
Each state has different licensing/registration requirements.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
Each state handles contractor oversight differently:
- **Virginia:** DPOR issues Class A, B, or C contractor licenses based on contract size and annual volume
- **Maryland:** MHIC (Maryland Home Improvement Commission) licenses home improvement contractors, requiring $500,000 minimum liability insurance as of June 2024
- **Pennsylvania:** No state license, but HICPA requires registration with Attorney General for contractors doing $5,000+ annually

Roof-ER maintains proper licensing/registration in all three states.

**Citation:** VA Code Title 54.1; MD Business Regulation Title 8; PA 73 P.S. 517.1

### Q425: Adjuster says:
"Your contractor shouldn't be at this meeting."

**Short Answer (with source):**
Contractors can attend to provide technical expertise.

**Detailed Answer (Training Draft):**
To whom it may concern,

While I cannot negotiate or advise on policy coverage, I am permitted to attend this meeting to provide technical expertise. I can clarify repair methods, point out damage you may not have observed, explain building code requirements, and answer questions about my estimate. This helps ensure an accurate scope of repairs is documented. The homeowner has requested my presence.
