Our Culture & Your Commitment
Our Mission:
At Roof-ER, our mission is to hold a fiduciary responsibility to our customers - plain and simple. In
an industry known for poor workmanship, lack of communication, and at times, outright deceit; we
seek to restore the name of exterior remodeling contractors nationwide. By committing to our core
values of Integrity, Quality, and Simplicity, we promise to deliver an experience every homeowner
wants when remodeling their home: a simple and straightforward quality installation for a fair and
honest price.
Our Core Values:
Integrity: At Roof-ER, we set the standard for Integrity in an industry that has lost credibility among
many consumers. We do not only set the standard of integrity with our clients, but it starts with
being honest to ourselves. We have the courage to truly see ourselves, recognize where we can
grow, and implement changes to meet the demands of reality.
Quality: We guarantee the highest Quality in our products and services. Our confidence in our craft
propels us into the elite 1% of all roofing companies in the entire nation. Quality starts with the
moment a client interacts with one of our representatives at the door. The Quality demonstrated in
every aspect of what we do continues to make Roof-ER the gold standard of this industry.
Simplicity: We strive to deliver an overwhelmingly positive experience for everyone who interacts
with Roof-ER. By embracing the complexities of our industry, we provide exceptional results to our
clients. Our clients value the Simplicity of partnering with us – we guarantee a seamless process
from start to finish ensuring satisfaction with the final outcome.
Your Commitment:
I will conduct myself in alignment with the Mission and Core Values.
I will dedicate myself to Roof-ER’s successful sales process.
I will always show an exceptional level of integrity when interacting with clients, co-workers, and
(especially) myself.
I will listen to and grow from receiving constructive feedback.
I will not be afraid to communicate with the correct individual(s) when I have an issue or grievance.
I will not be involved in gossip or “company drama.”
I will be an effective and contributing member of the Roof-ER team.
I will show an intense level of discipline in the work that I conduct.
I will not let negativity or “bad days” have a detrimental impact on my work ethic and the quality of
what I do.
I will have pride in my work.
I will do what it takes to commit to this. I will achieve tremendous levels of success. I have seen the
success that others achieved by committing to this process - I WILL be part of that.

Notes: Per Virginia Residential Building Code R905.2.2 - Slope: "Asphalt shingles shall be used
only on roof slopes of two units vertical in 12 units horizontal (17-percent slope) or greater."
The Rear slope approved for replacement has Steepness Pitch of 1/12; Therefore Flat/Rubber/TPO
roofing must be installed to be compliant with State Building Code
You can just copy and paste what is above (and edit the pitch of course) and send that to your
adjuster, or have your customer send that to the adjuster

The 2018 IRC
Chapter 7 Wall Covering
R703.1 General. Exterior walls shall provide the building with a weather-resistant exterior wall
envelope. The exterior wall envelope shall include flashing as described in Section R703.4.
R703.1.1 Water resistance. The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed in a
manner that prevents the accumulation of water within the wall assembly by providing a
water-resistant barrier behind the exterior veneer as required by Section R703.2 and a means of
draining to the exterior water that enters the assembly.
Importance of Moisture Management
R703.2 Water-resistive barrier. One layer of No. 15 asphalt felt, free from holes and breaks,
complying with ASTM D226 for Type I felt or other approved water-resistive barrier shall be applied
over studs or sheathing of all exterior walls. Such felt or material shall be applied horizontally, with
the upper layer lapped over the lower layer not less than 2 inches (51mm). Where joints occur, felt
shall be lapped not less than 6 inches (152mm). The felt or other approved material shall be
continuous to the top of walls and terminated at penetrations and building appendages in a manner
to meet the requirements of the exterior wall envelope as described in Section R703.1.
R703.4 Flashing. Approved corrosion-resistant flashing shall be applied shingle-fashion in a
manner to prevent the entry of water into the wall cavity or penetration of water to the building
structural framing components. Self-adhered membranes used as flashing shall comply with AAMA
(Ameri-can Architectural Manufacturers Association) 711. Fluid-applied membranes used as
flashing in exterior walls shall comply with AAMA 714. The flashing shall extend to the surface of
the exterior wall finish. Approved corrosion-resistant flashings shall be installed at:
Exterior window and door openings. Flashing at exterior window and door openings shall extend to
the surface of the exterior wall finish or to the water-resistive barrier complying with Section R703.2
for subsequent drainage. Mechanically attached flexible flashings shall comply with AAMA 712.
R703.7.3 Water-resistive barriers. Water-resistive barriers shall be installed as required in Section
R703.2 and, where applied over wood-based sheathing, shall include a water-resistive
vapor-permeable barrier with a performance at least equivalent to two layers of Grade D paper. The
individual layers shall be installed independently such that each layer provides a separate
continuous plane and any flashing (installed in accordance with Section R703.4) intended to drain
to the water-resistive barrier is directed between the layers.
Exceptions:
Where the water-resistive barrier that is applied over wood-based sheathing has a water resistance
equal to or greater than that of 60-minute Grade D paper and is separated from the stucco by an
intervening, substantially non-water-absorbing layer or designed drainage space.
