Per **Virginia Code 38.2-1845.1 et seq.:**

1. Accept commission, fee, or compensation for investigating/settling claims
2. Prepare, complete, or file insurance claims on behalf of insured
3. Aid or act on behalf of insured in negotiating claim settlements
4. Advertise for employment as a public adjuster
5. Solicit, investigate, or adjust claims on behalf of insured

### What Contractors CAN Do

1. Prepare estimates for repair work
2. Document damage with photos and measurements
3. Provide technical information to adjusters
4. Answer questions about their estimates
5. Attend adjuster meetings to clarify technical points

**Citation:** Virginia Code 38.2-1845.12 (Standards of conduct for public adjusters)

## Building Code Requirements (2021 Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code)

### Ice Barrier Requirements
**Virginia Residential Code R905.1.2:**
- Required in areas with history of ice forming along eaves
- Must extend from lowest roof edge to point not less than 24 inches inside exterior wall line
- For slopes 8:12 or greater: must extend 36 inches from eave edge

### Drip Edge Requirements
- Not prescriptively required by VUSBC
- HOWEVER: Required if shingle manufacturer specifies it
- Most manufacturers (GAF, Owens Corning, CertainTeed) require drip edge
- Installation must comply with manufacturer instructions

**Strategy:** Always cite manufacturer requirements when arguing for drip edge coverage

### Flashing Requirements
**Virginia Existing Building Code 908.5:**
- Existing flashings, edgings, outlets, vents or similar devices SHALL be replaced where rusted, damaged, or deteriorated
- Step flashing, valley flashing, chimney flashing must be replaced when roofing is disturbed

### Permit Requirements
**What Does NOT Require a Permit:**
- Replacement of unlimited roof covering in R-3, R-4, R-5 (if wind speed <100 mph)
- Replacement of 100 sq ft or less of roof covering in all groups

**What REQUIRES a Permit:**
- Replacement of roof sheathing (decking) exceeding 256 sq ft
- Any work in historic districts (local determination)

**Strategy:** Pull permit when replacing sheathing - this triggers full code inspection and validates all code upgrades

### Ventilation Requirements
- Must be brought to code compliance during reroofing
- Virginia follows IRC Chapter 8 ventilation requirements

## Matching Requirements in Virginia

### Current Status
- **No specific Virginia statute** mandating matching
- Policy language governs
- Case-by-case determination based on:
  - Policy terms (RCV vs ACV)
  - Whether policy excludes matching
  - "Like kind and quality" language interpretation

### Strategy for Matching Claims
1. Check if policy has matching exclusion
2. If no exclusion, cite "like kind and quality" language
3. Document aesthetic impact with photos
4. Consider purchasing matching endorsement for future policies

## Code Upgrade Coverage (Ordinance or Law)

### Key Issue
Insurance companies may deny code upgrades claiming they're not "enforced" because permits aren't required for covering replacement.

### Counter-Strategy
1. Pull permit when replacing sheathing (triggers full inspection)
2. All aspects of job will be inspected
3. Code requirements become enforceable
4. Document all code-required items in Xactimate

**Items to Include:**
- Ice and water shield (if in ice dam zone)
- Drip edge (per manufacturer requirements)
- New underlayment (required on tear-off)
- Flashing replacement
- Ventilation upgrades

2. Prepare the insurance claim for customer
3. Negotiate the claim with insurance company on customer's behalf

## Maryland Matching Requirements

### MIA Bulletin 18-23 (October 30, 2018)

**Key Points:**
1. Updates original Bulletin 97-1 (1997)

**Settlement Options When No Exclusion Exists:**
1. Move undamaged siding from less visible areas to replace damaged
2. Replace both damaged and undamaged siding on one or more sides
3. Replace all siding
4. Monetary allowance reflecting diminution in value

**Critical Note:** Most policies NOW contain specific mismatch exclusions. Always:
1. Review policy for mismatch exclusion language
2. If no exclusion, cite Bulletin 18-23 and 97-1
3. Document mismatch with before/after photos

### Roof Matching
- Bulletin 18-23 specifically states mismatch exclusions "may apply to aluminum siding claims as well as other exterior finish materials such as roofing"
- Same analysis applies to shingles

## Pennsylvania Insurance Regulations

### Aerial Imagery Notice 2024-06

### Strategy

4. Request optional matching coverage for future policies

## Effective Strategies for Pennsylvania

### Documentation Best Practices
