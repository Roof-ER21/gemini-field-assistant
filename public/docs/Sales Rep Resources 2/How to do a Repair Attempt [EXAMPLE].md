Filming Repair Attempt Video

Before you begin filming, ask the Field Tech (Francisco or Ishmael) to point out which of the surrounding shingles will be affected by the extraction. Mark the damaged tab (if applicable) and mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.

Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle. Start recording, state the Homeowners name and house number. “...Here we are at [HOMEOWNER’S HOUSE at 1234 (street name)] performing a repair attempt on this storm damaged shingle. As you can see I have pre-marked every tab that will sustain unavoidable creasing due to the brittleness of the roof. Go ahead and get started Francisco/Ishmael”

Film the entire area where repair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process. Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount of granule loss running down the roof.

Once the new shingle has been installed, hover the camera over the shingles and wipe your hand back and forth gently or blow over the top of each tab that was pried up. Trace your finger along the crease and show it on camera, explain how each tab has now been mechanically creased and confirms the roof failed a “brittle test”. (picture below)

Once you have finished recording your video. Take close-up after pictures of the rows above the replaced shingle. Draw an arrow to where the crease is on the shingle or point to it for the picture.

(see good examples of after pics below email template)

To whom it may concern,

Please see the attached video link and photos of the attempted repair for the claim number (#__________).

As can be clearly seen in the evidence provided, the homeowner's roof sustained additional damage during the attempted repairs. Thus confirming a failed brittle test for the shingles, indicating irreparability for the roof as a whole.

With this fact established, your current estimate does not adequately address the needs of this roof. Performing further patch repairs as [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME] has suggested will unintentionally, yet unavoidably, cause further extensive damage to surrounding shingles. Therefore I have gone ahead and attached an estimate that accurately reflects the full scope of work necessary to make our mutual client whole again.

I also ask that you take note of the attached before and after pictures of the attempted repair. These photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably do further unavoidable damage to surrounding shingles.

Please review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so we can begin to move forward with the full roof replacement for [HOMEOWNER NAME]. If we can provide any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your time and for working with us to assist [HOMEOWNER] in restoring their property effectively after the loss they have experienced.
