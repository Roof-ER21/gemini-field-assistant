## Template

Subject: Update on Permit Status - [Property Address]

Dear [Adjuster Name],

We recently applied for a permit to replace the aluminum siding on the affected elevation. However, the Township has denied the permit, citing that a full replacement is required to meet local building codes.

We have attached a copy of the denied permit to this email. As you can see, the Township is requiring a full replacement to ensure compliance with local regulations.

In light of this new information, we kindly request that you reconsider the estimate and update it to include the full replacement costs. We believe that this is necessary to ensure that the repairs are done correctly and in compliance with local building codes.

Please let us know if you need any additional information from us to facilitate this request.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

## Why This Works

**Leverage Authority:** By using the denied permit as evidence, you shift the decision from subjective judgment to objective regulatory requirement. The township's authority supersedes the adjuster's partial approval.

**Compliance Focus:** Framing the request around "compliance with local building codes" positions the full replacement as mandatory, not optional.

**Documentation:** Attaching the denied permit provides irrefutable proof and makes it difficult for the adjuster to push back without appearing to encourage code violations.

**Professional Tone:** The respectful, matter-of-fact approach makes it easy for the adjuster to approve without feeling challenged or defensive.

## Key Strategy Points

1. **Apply for Partial Permit First** - This creates the denial documentation you need
2. **Attach Permit Denial** - Physical evidence is crucial
3. **Cite Code Compliance** - Makes it about regulations, not preferences
4. **Request Reconsideration** - Positions this as new information, not an argument
5. **Pennsylvania-Specific** - Different townships may have varying requirements
