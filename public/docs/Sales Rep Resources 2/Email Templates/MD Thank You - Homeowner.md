## Maryland-Specific Language Points

### Insurance Context (if claim was approved):
"Your insurance company has approved coverage under Maryland's comprehensive roofing regulations. We'll ensure full compliance with IRC R908.3 matching requirements and all applicable building codes."

### After Initial Meeting:
"I've documented the storm damage to your roof and will be submitting a detailed claim package to [Insurance Company]. Maryland law requires proper matching of discontinued materials, which strengthens your case for full replacement."

### After Signing Contract:
"Your contract is protected under Maryland Home Improvement Commission regulations. You have a 3-day right of rescission, and all work will be performed to Maryland's 2021 IRC building code standards."

## State-Specific Compliance Notes

**Maryland Requirements Referenced:**
- MHIC License disclosure (required on all written communications)
- IRC R908.3 matching law (Maryland's most powerful claim argument)
- 3-day right of rescission (consumer protection)
- 2021 IRC building code compliance

**DO NOT:**
- Guarantee claim approval (insurance decides)
- Promise specific timelines without weather disclaimers
- Discuss pricing in thank you emails (keep separate)
- Make legal claims about insurance obligations (stay factual)

**DO:**
- Reference Maryland-specific protections
- Provide multiple contact methods
- Set realistic expectations
- Show appreciation genuinely
