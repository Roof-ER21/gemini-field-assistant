To whom it may concern:

This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER.  I am assisting [CUSTOMER’s NAME].  Attached is our Photo Report, Claim Authorization, and GAF Storm Damage Guidelines.

GAF's guideline to not repair any more than 2 or 3 shingles.  A repair at the level that is in your current decision would cause significantly more damage to [CUSTOMER NAMES]’s roof, and would not be an effective solution to restore his property after the hail storm that impacted his house.

Please update your current estimate to take this into consideration.

We sincerely appreciate your time and assistance.
