Dear [Homeowner Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on [our meeting/your roof assessment/your insurance claim] for your property at [Property Address].

**Where We Are:**

[Choose appropriate context:]

**After Initial Meeting:**
Since our meeting on [Date], I've [prepared your detailed proposal/submitted your claim to Insurance Company/completed the inspection report]. I wanted to make sure you received everything and answer any questions you might have.

**After Claim Submission:**
I submitted your claim package to [Insurance Company] on [Date]. Typically, adjusters respond within 3-5 business days. I'll keep you updated as soon as I hear from them.

**After Proposal Sent:**
I sent over your detailed proposal on [Date]. I know it's a lot of information to review - I'm happy to walk through any section that needs clarification.

**Next Steps:**

1. **If you have questions** - Call/text me anytime: [Rep Phone]
2. **If you're ready to move forward** - We can [schedule installation/finalize paperwork/submit your claim]
3. **If you need more time** - No problem! Take the time you need, and I'll check back in [timeframe]

**Virginia-Specific Update:**

[Choose relevant section:]

**For Insurance Claims:**
Virginia doesn't have matching requirements like Maryland, so our claim strategy focuses on demonstrating that repairs aren't viable. Your [Brand/Style] shingles from [Year] are brittle and won't re-seal properly - creating a safety hazard and violating manufacturer warranty terms.

**For Cash Customers:**
All work will be performed to Virginia's 2021 Residential Code standards. We're Class A licensed (#[XXXX]) through Virginia DPOR and carry $2M liability coverage for your protection.

**Questions I'm Here to Answer:**

- Timeline questions?
- Insurance coverage concerns?
- Product/warranty questions?
- Financing options?
- Anything else?

**My Commitment to You:**

Whether you move forward with Roof-ER or not, I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision for your home. No pressure - just support.

Feel free to call or text me directly: [Rep Phone]

Best regards,

## Follow-Up Timing Guide

### First Follow-Up:
- **After initial meeting**: 24-48 hours
- **After proposal sent**: 2-3 days
- **After claim submission**: Weekly updates
- **After no response**: 1 week

### Second Follow-Up:
- **If no response to first**: 5-7 days later
- **If questions remain**: Within 24 hours of their inquiry
- **If waiting on insurance**: Every 5-7 days

### Final Follow-Up:
- **Before closing file**: 2-3 weeks after last contact
- **Seasonal reminder**: 6 months later (storm season)

## Virginia Context-Specific Variations

### After Storm Event:
"I wanted to follow up after [Storm Name/Date]. Many homes in your neighborhood sustained damage. Virginia insurance law requires claims be filed within a reasonable time of discovering damage. If you haven't already, I recommend scheduling a free inspection."

### After Adjuster Meeting:
"Following our meeting with [Adjuster Name] yesterday, I've documented [X areas of concern]. Since Virginia doesn't have matching requirements, I'm focusing on the repairability argument - your shingles are too brittle to repair safely. I'll be preparing a supplement request and will keep you updated."

### After Denial:
"I received [Insurance Company]'s denial letter regarding your claim. Don't worry - denials are common and often overturned. In Virginia, we focus on demonstrating that repairs create safety hazards and violate manufacturer warranties. I've successfully appealed [X]% of initial denials. Here's our appeal strategy..."

### After Approval (Lowball):
"[Insurance Company] approved your claim for $[Amount]. However, this appears to be a lowball offer that doesn't account for proper code compliance or the safety issues with partial repairs. I've identified $[Additional Amount] in missing items. Let me walk you through the supplement process."

## Tone Guidelines

## Example Full Email (After Proposal Sent)

Subject: Following up - Any questions about your Roof-ER proposal?

---

Dear Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on the proposal I sent over on Tuesday for your Virginia Beach home.

**Where We Are:**

I've prepared a comprehensive estimate for your full roof replacement, including:
- GAF Timberline HDZ shingles (Charcoal - to match existing)
- Full tear-off and disposal
- Ice & water shield upgrades per 2021 VRC
- 25-year workmanship warranty
- GAF Lifetime System warranty

**Virginia-Specific Details:**

Since your original Timberline shingles (installed 2010) are now brittle and won't re-seal if we attempt partial repairs, replacement is the safest and most cost-effective option. Virginia code requires proper installation to manufacturer specs, which your current shingles can no longer meet.

**Next Steps - Your Choice:**

1. **Have questions about the proposal?** Call/text me: (757) 555-1234
2. **Ready to move forward with the claim?** I can submit to Allstate as early as tomorrow
3. **Need more time to decide?** No problem - take the time you need

**I'm Here to Help:**

Whether you have technical questions about the materials, want to discuss the insurance process, or need clarification on anything - I'm available 7 days a week.

A few common questions I get at this stage:
- "How long does the insurance process take?" (Typically 2-3 weeks)
- "What if Allstate approves less than your estimate?" (We supplement - at no cost to you)
- "When could you start?" (Usually 2-3 weeks after claim approval, weather permitting)

Feel free to call or text anytime: (757) 555-1234

P.S. I noticed when we met that you mentioned the leak over your garage. That's exactly the kind of active damage adjusters look for. Make sure to point it out if the adjuster contacts you directly before I can attend the inspection.

## Virginia Legal Compliance

**MUST Include:**
- VA Class A License number on all written communications
- Accurate representation of insurance process
- No guarantees of claim approval
- Professional licensure references

**MUST NOT:**
- Guarantee insurance outcomes
- Make unauthorized legal claims
- Pressure customers with false urgency
- Reference Maryland matching laws (VA doesn't have them)

**RECOMMENDED:**
- Reference Virginia-specific regulations factually
- Focus on repairability arguments (not matching)
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Document all communications

## Virginia Claim Strategy

**Key Arguments for VA Claims:**
1. **Shingle Brittleness**: Age makes repairs unsafe
2. **Manufacturer Warranty**: Repairs void warranty
3. **Code Compliance**: Partial repairs don't meet VRC standards
4. **Safety Hazards**: Brittle shingles create liability
5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Repairs lead to ongoing issues

**NOT Valid in Virginia:**
- Matching requirements (MD only)
- Color/style mismatch arguments
- Aesthetic concerns

## Tracking & Follow-Up System

**Use CRM to track:**
- Date of each follow-up sent
- Customer response (or lack thereof)
- Next scheduled follow-up
- Status: Active, Waiting, Closed

**Escalation Path:**
- 1st follow-up: Rep
- 2nd follow-up: Rep
- 3rd follow-up: Sales Manager check-in
- 4th follow-up: Final attempt before seasonal reminder

**When to Stop Following Up:**
- Customer explicitly declines
- 3 follow-ups with no response (move to seasonal list)
- Customer chooses competitor
- Claim denied and appeal unsuccessful
