Dear [Homeowner Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on [our meeting/your roof assessment/your insurance claim] for your property at [Property Address].

**Where We Are:**

[Choose appropriate context:]

**After Initial Meeting:**
Since our meeting on [Date], I've [prepared your detailed proposal/submitted your claim to Insurance Company/completed the inspection report]. I wanted to make sure you received everything and answer any questions you might have.

**After Claim Submission:**
I submitted your claim package to [Insurance Company] on [Date]. Typically, adjusters respond within 3-5 business days. I'll keep you updated as soon as I hear from them.

**After Proposal Sent:**
I sent over your detailed proposal on [Date]. I know it's a lot of information to review - I'm happy to walk through any section that needs clarification.

**Next Steps:**

1. **If you have questions** - Call/text me anytime: [Rep Phone]
2. **If you're ready to move forward** - We can [schedule installation/finalize paperwork/submit your claim]
3. **If you need more time** - No problem! Take the time you need, and I'll check back in [timeframe]

**Maryland-Specific Update:**

[Choose relevant section:]

**For Insurance Claims:**
Maryland's IRC R908.3 matching law works strongly in your favor. Since your [Brand/Style] shingles are discontinued, full replacement is not just recommended - it's required by code for proper matching. This significantly strengthens your claim.

**For Cash Customers:**
All work will be performed to Maryland's 2021 IRC building code standards. We're MHIC licensed (#[XXXX]) and carry $2M liability coverage for your protection.

**Questions I'm Here to Answer:**

- Timeline questions?
- Insurance coverage concerns?
- Product/warranty questions?
- Financing options?
- Anything else?

**My Commitment to You:**

Whether you move forward with Roof-ER or not, I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision for your home. No pressure - just support.

Feel free to call or text me directly: [Rep Phone]

Best regards,

## Follow-Up Timing Guide

### First Follow-Up:
- **After initial meeting**: 24-48 hours
- **After proposal sent**: 2-3 days
- **After claim submission**: Weekly updates
- **After no response**: 1 week

### Second Follow-Up:
- **If no response to first**: 5-7 days later
- **If questions remain**: Within 24 hours of their inquiry
- **If waiting on insurance**: Every 5-7 days

### Final Follow-Up:
- **Before closing file**: 2-3 weeks after last contact
- **Seasonal reminder**: 6 months later (storm season)

## Maryland Context-Specific Variations

### After Storm Event:
"I wanted to follow up after [Storm Name/Date]. Many homes in your neighborhood sustained damage. Maryland insurance law requires claims be filed within 12 months of the damage occurrence. If you haven't already, I recommend scheduling a free inspection."

### After Adjuster Meeting:
"Following our meeting with [Adjuster Name] yesterday, I've documented [X areas of concern]. Maryland's matching requirements under IRC R908.3 support full replacement rather than partial repair. I'll be preparing a supplement request and will keep you updated."

### After Denial:
"I received [Insurance Company]'s denial letter regarding your claim. Don't worry - denials are common and often overturned. Maryland has specific consumer protections, and I've successfully appealed [X]% of initial denials. Here's our appeal strategy..."

### After Approval (Lowball):
"[Insurance Company] approved your claim for $[Amount]. However, this appears to be a lowball offer that doesn't account for Maryland's matching requirements or code compliance costs. I've identified $[Additional Amount] in missing items. Let me walk you through the supplement process."

## Tone Guidelines

- **Helpful, Not Pushy**: Offer value, not pressure
- **Patient**: Respect their timeline
- **Available**: Show you're there when they need you

## Example Full Email (After Proposal Sent)

Subject: Following up - Any questions about your Roof-ER proposal?

---

Dear Jennifer,

I hope you and Mark are doing well! I wanted to follow up on the proposal I sent over on Tuesday for your Columbia home.

**Where We Are:**

I've prepared a comprehensive estimate for your full roof replacement, including:
- GAF Timberline HDZ shingles (Weathered Wood - to match existing)
- Full tear-off and disposal
- Ice & water shield upgrades per 2021 IRC
- 25-year workmanship warranty
- GAF Lifetime System warranty

**Maryland-Specific Details:**

Since your original Timberline HD shingles (installed 2008) are discontinued, Maryland's IRC R908.3 matching law supports full replacement rather than partial repair. This is a significant advantage in your State Farm claim.

**Next Steps - Your Choice:**

1. **Have questions about the proposal?** Call/text me: (443) 555-1234
2. **Ready to move forward with the claim?** I can submit to State Farm as early as tomorrow
3. **Need more time to decide?** No problem - take the time you need

**I'm Here to Help:**

Whether you have technical questions about the materials, want to discuss the insurance process, or need clarification on anything - I'm available 7 days a week.

A few common questions I get at this stage:
- "How long does the insurance process take?" (Typically 2-3 weeks)
- "What if State Farm approves less than your estimate?" (We supplement - at no cost to you)
- "When could you start?" (Usually 2-3 weeks after claim approval, weather permitting)

Feel free to call or text anytime: (443) 555-1234

Best regards,

P.S. I noticed when we met that you mentioned the leak over your master bedroom. That's exactly the kind of damage adjusters look for. Make sure to point it out if the adjuster contacts you directly before I can attend the inspection.
