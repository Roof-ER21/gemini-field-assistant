To whom it may concern,

I, a loyal customer of [INSURANCE COMPANY], find your current decision for my home unacceptable.  I have chosen [INSURANCE COMPANY] to protect my home in the event that I find myself in this situation.  Your current decision will not effectively address the needs of my home after the loss we have suffered from the storm.

My contractor, who is CCâ€™d in this email, has provided documentation that outlines the most effective way to make my property whole again [AND/OR] while your current decision would be an ineffective solution for my roof [AND/OR] siding.

Please update your decision/estimate to reflect a full roof [AND/OR] siding approval. If necessary, please have someone else come back to inspect the property.

Please let my contractor or myself know if you need anything else from us.

We look forward to hearing from you soon,
