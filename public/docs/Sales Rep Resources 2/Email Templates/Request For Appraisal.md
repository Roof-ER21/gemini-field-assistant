To Whom It May Concern,

This letter is to notify you that we strongly disagree with the amount of loss you have calculated on the above referenced claim. As a result of our inability to reach an agreeable settlement on the “amount of loss”, we hereby invoke the appraisal clause, in writing, per our policy. This written demand is to advise you that this appraisal will include the “amount of loss” for Cov A (Dwelling). My contractor, Reese Samala [Edit this to your name] with Roof ER, has provided and submitted evidence of the necessity for our roof [and siding - please remove this if it is roof only] to be fully replaced and have estimated that cost to be $39,705.35, [please edit this amount to the repair/supplemented estimate that Danny, Amber, or Ed wrote.] while Allstate [please change if not Allstate] has provided a partial replacement estimate for $7,259.21. [please edit the amount of this partial to what the insurance company’s most recent partial is.]

We have selected Edmund O’Brien. He can be reached at:

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Please notify us, as well as our appraiser, as to whom you will be naming as your appraiser. Please include as much contact information you can on this individual so the appraisal process can begin as soon as possible.
