Documentation & Templates (Q101–Q125)

Q101: Question:

When should the Repair Attempt Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when a repair was attempted and shingles cracked, tore, or failed — proving irreparability .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Repair Attempt Template should be used anytime a repair test is performed and the shingles crack, tear, or break when manipulated. This template documents the attempt and outcome, proving to insurance that repairs are not feasible. It provides a professional, standardized way to present irreparability .

Q102: Adjuster says:

“Repair attempt wasn’t necessary.”

Short Answer (with source):

Repair attempts are industry standard to determine reparability .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair attempts are an industry-accepted method to test whether shingles are repairable. Our documented attempt caused additional damage, confirming brittleness and irreparability. This supports the need for full replacement .

Q103: Homeowner asks:

“Why did you damage my roof during testing?”

Short Answer (with source):

The brittle test is standard and proves shingles can’t be repaired .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The brittle test may look like damage, but it’s an industry-accepted method to confirm whether shingles are repairable. By carefully attempting to lift and reseal shingles, we document whether they fracture. If they do, as in this case, it proves irreparability and strengthens your claim for full replacement .

Q104: Carrier says:

“Your repair attempt caused the damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Damage during repair attempt proves brittleness, not contractor error .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated our repair attempt caused the damage. In reality, the cracking during the attempt is the proof of brittleness and irreparability. The Repair Attempt Template documents this result. Repairs would cause more harm, confirming the need for replacement .

Q105: Question:

When should the Generic Partial Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when insurance approves only part of a roof/siding but evidence supports more .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Generic Partial Template is used whenever a carrier approves partial coverage — such as one slope or one wall of siding — while documentation shows consistent storm damage on more areas. The template provides standardized language to request full coverage .

Q106: Adjuster says:

“We only approved the slope with visible damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our inspection found collateral damage across multiple slopes .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved one slope only. Our inspection and photo report show consistent collateral damage across multiple slopes. Storm impact is not limited to a single slope. The Generic Partial Template language applies to request revision .

Q107: Carrier says:

“We left gutters out — no evidence of damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Photo report shows gutter dents and granule wash consistent with storm .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You omitted gutters. Our photo report shows storm-related dents and granule washout in gutters. These are valid storm impacts that must be included. The Generic Partial Template can be used to request full scope .

Q108: Adjuster says:

“We’ll cover siding on one wall only.”

Short Answer (with source):

Maryland matching requirement prohibits mismatched siding .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your approval of one siding wall ignores matching requirements. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless excluded by policy. The Generic Partial Template applies to request full replacement .

Q109: Homeowner asks:

“Why do we need the Generic Partial Template?”

Short Answer (with source):

It challenges partial approvals by showing all affected areas .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Generic Partial Template is needed when the insurance company tries to pay for only part of the damage. It uses standardized language to point out that storm damage affected more than just one slope or wall. It helps push for full approval .

Q110: Question:

When should the Photo Report Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use whenever submitting photographic proof of damage to insurance .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Photo Report Template should be used whenever you compile photographic evidence of storm damage. It organizes pictures clearly and ties them to specific observations, making it easier for insurance to recognize the full scope of damage .

Q111: Adjuster says:

“Photos don’t prove functional damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Photo report documents creases, mat exposure, and missing shingles .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed our photos. The Photo Report Template clearly documents creased shingles, exposed mats, and missing tabs. These conditions are functional damage, not cosmetic, and require replacement .

Q112: Carrier says:

“Collateral damage isn’t covered.”

Short Answer (with source):

Collateral (gutters, metals, screens) helps prove storm event .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded collateral. Our photo report documents dents in gutters and metals. These items confirm storm event impact and must be considered when determining full scope .

Q113: Homeowner asks:

“Why are photos important if the adjuster already inspected?”

Short Answer (with source):

Photos create a permanent record and highlight missed damage .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Photos are essential because they provide a permanent, timestamped record of storm damage. Even if an adjuster inspected, photos highlight missed or overlooked issues. The Photo Report Template ensures this evidence is presented clearly .

Q114: Adjuster says:

“Your photos don’t show hail size.”

Short Answer (with source):

Damage, not hail size, determines coverage — shown in report .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed our photos due to hail size. Insurance coverage is based on damage, not size. Our photo report documents functional impacts: bruises, granule loss, and fractures. These require replacement regardless of stone size .

Q115: Carrier says:

“Photos aren’t professional evidence.”

Short Answer (with source):

Photo reports are industry standard for claim documentation .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated photos aren’t valid evidence. In fact, photo reports are an industry standard and form part of nearly every claim review. They are recognized as valid proof of storm damage .

Q116: Question:

When should the Customer-to-Insurance Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when homeowner must pressure carrier directly for fair claim handling .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Customer-to-Insurance Template should be used when a carrier delays, denies, or refuses fair inspection. Insurance companies respond more seriously when the request comes directly from their policyholder. This template ensures the homeowner speaks in the right language .

Q117: Homeowner asks:

“Why do I need to send the letter instead of Roof-ER?”

Short Answer (with source):

Insurance responds more when it comes from the policyholder .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Insurance companies must respond directly to their customers. When Roof-ER sends a letter, it may not carry the same weight. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures the homeowner applies pressure themselves, often getting faster results .

Q118: Carrier says:

“We already explained our decision.”

Short Answer (with source):

Customer letter reinforces their rights and requests reconsideration .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

The policyholder has the right to challenge your decision. Using the Customer-to-Insurance Template, they’ve reiterated their request for fair handling and restoration to pre-loss condition. A customer’s direct appeal requires serious consideration .

Q119: Homeowner asks:

“What if I don’t feel comfortable pushing insurance?”

Short Answer (with source):

We provide the template — they just copy/paste it .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The homeowner doesn’t need to “fight” with insurance. They simply copy/paste the provided Customer-to-Insurance Template into an email and send it. Roof-ER provides the wording; the customer’s role is only to hit send .

Q120: Adjuster says:

“Customer letters don’t change anything.”

Short Answer (with source):

Carrier must respond when request comes from policyholder .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said customer letters don’t matter. However, you are required to respond directly to the policyholder. The Customer-to-Insurance Template ensures their request is framed clearly. This obligates a reconsideration under fair claims handling .

Q121: Question:

When should the Siding Argument Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when siding is discontinued, mismatched, or requires wrap removal .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Siding Argument Template is used when siding cannot be repaired due to discontinuation, mismatches, or because removal of housewrap causes consequential damage. It standardizes the language for challenging siding denials .

Q122: Adjuster says:

“We’ll just replace one siding panel.”

Short Answer (with source):

Panel removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing damage .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed panel replacement. Per our siding argument documentation, removing one panel requires detaching adjoining ones and often the corner post. This causes consequential damage and makes panel-only replacement infeasible .

Q123: Carrier says:

“We found a close match.”

Short Answer (with source):

iTel confirmed no reasonable match exists; close isn’t acceptable .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated a close siding match exists. The iTel report confirms no reasonable match is available. Color and profile mismatches reduce property value and fail to restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .

Q124: Homeowner asks:

“Why can’t you just paint or blend siding?”

Short Answer (with source):

Painting/mixing voids warranty and doesn’t restore pre-loss condition .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Painting or blending siding may seem like a solution, but it voids manufacturer warranty and doesn’t restore the home to its pre-loss condition. The Siding Argument Template explains why only full replacement is acceptable .

Q125: Adjuster says:

“Housewrap isn’t necessary for siding repair.”

Short Answer (with source):

MD Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier behind siding .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied housewrap during siding repair. Per Maryland Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting WRB violates code and risks moisture intrusion. This must be included .

Q126: Carrier says:

“We can repair aluminum siding dents.”

Short Answer (with source):

Aluminum siding dents are permanent; replacement required .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested aluminum siding can be repaired. Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected — they are permanent. Per our siding argument, dented panels must be replaced to restore pre-loss condition .

Q127: Adjuster says:

“We’ll just replace a few vinyl panels.”

Short Answer (with source):

Vinyl becomes brittle with age; panel removal causes cracking .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved only a few vinyl siding panels. Per our siding argument, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks when removed, making panel-only replacement impossible. Full wall replacement is required .

Q128: Carrier says:

“We’ll blend new siding with old.”

Short Answer (with source):

Blending creates mismatched color/profile; iTel confirms no match .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed blending new with old siding. The iTel report confirms no suitable match is available. Mixing profiles and colors creates mismatches and does not restore pre-loss condition. Full replacement is required .

Q129: Homeowner asks:

“What if siding mismatch doesn’t bother me?”

Short Answer (with source):

Insurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Even if mismatches don’t bother the homeowner, insurance is obligated to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. Per our siding argument, mismatched siding reduces value and fails to meet claim requirements .

Q130: Carrier says:

“We’ll paint siding to match.”

Short Answer (with source):

Painting voids warranty and fades differently than factory siding .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested painting new siding to match. Per our siding argument, painting siding voids manufacturer warranty and fades unevenly compared to factory finish. This is not a valid repair. Replacement is required .

Q131: Question:

When should the Estimate Request Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when insurance estimate omits items or underpays scope .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Estimate Request Template is used whenever the insurance estimate is incomplete — missing items like flashing, underlayment, siding wrap, or when pricing is too low. It provides professional, standardized language to request corrections .

Q132: Adjuster says:

“Our estimate is final.”

Short Answer (with source):

New evidence requires revision — outlined in Estimate Request Template .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said the estimate is final. The Estimate Request Template provides standardized language to show new documentation (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires revision of your estimate. We respectfully request corrections .

Q133: Carrier says:

“We don’t owe for code compliance.”

Short Answer (with source):

Estimate Request Template cites VA/MD code upgrades .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied code items. The Estimate Request Template language cites specific state codes, such as Maryland Code R703 (WRB) and VA Code 908.5 (flashing). These are not optional — they are code requirements that must be included .

Q134: Homeowner asks:

“Why is your estimate higher than insurance’s?”

Short Answer (with source):

We include all code-required and manufacturer-required items .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Our estimate may be higher because it includes all code-required upgrades and manufacturer-required components that insurance sometimes leaves out. The Estimate Request Template is how we push back to ensure these are included .

Q135: Adjuster says:

“We don’t pay for underlayment.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF requires new underlayment; reusing voids warranty .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF installation standards, new underlayment must be installed when reroofing. Reusing underlayment voids warranty. The Estimate Request Template language requests this correction .

Q136: Carrier says:

“We don’t owe for flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

Flashing replacement required by VA Code 908.5 .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, all damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced when reroofing. This is a code requirement, not optional. The Estimate Request Template covers this correction .

Q137: Adjuster says:

“We priced shingles too low.”

Short Answer (with source):

Estimate Request Template ensures fair market pricing updates .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

The shingle pricing in your estimate is below current market value. The Estimate Request Template provides language to request market-appropriate pricing corrections. This ensures the claim reflects actual replacement costs .

Q138: Homeowner asks:

“Why did insurance’s estimate leave items out?”

Short Answer (with source):

Carriers often omit code/manufacturer items — we use Estimate Request Template to fix .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Insurance estimates frequently omit items like drip edge, flashing, or WRB. These omissions reduce the payout. We use the Estimate Request Template to point out and correct these errors so the homeowner receives full coverage .

Q139: Carrier says:

“We don’t pay for WRB.”

Short Answer (with source):

Maryland Code R703 requires water-resistive barrier .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded WRB. Per Maryland Code R703, siding must include a water-resistive barrier. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement and requests correction .

Q140: Adjuster says:

“We don’t owe for ridge vent.”

Short Answer (with source):

Ridge vents must be removed for slope replacement; new required .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing slopes and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template requests this correction .

Q141: Carrier says:

“We don’t owe for drip edge.”

Short Answer (with source):

IRC requires drip edge at eaves and rakes .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded drip edge. Per the IRC adopted in Virginia, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement for correction .

Q142: Homeowner asks:

“Why do you need to send estimate corrections?”

Short Answer (with source):

Corrections ensure code compliance and fair market value .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

We send estimate corrections to ensure all code-required items and market-appropriate pricing are included. Without corrections, homeowners are left with underfunded claims. The Estimate Request Template makes these corrections formal .

Q143: Adjuster says:

“Your corrections aren’t valid.”

Short Answer (with source):

Corrections are backed by manufacturer guidelines and state code .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve rejected our corrections. The Estimate Request Template is based on manufacturer requirements and building code citations. These are not optional suggestions; they are mandatory. Corrections must be made .

Q144: Carrier says:

“Your estimate inflates costs.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our estimate includes only code and manufacturer-required items .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated our estimate inflates costs. In reality, our estimate includes only what is required by building code and manufacturer standards. The Estimate Request Template ensures we justify these inclusions .

Q145: Adjuster says:

“We don’t cover valley flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

VA Code 908.5 requires flashing replacement .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded valley flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during reroofing. The Estimate Request Template cites this requirement .

Q146: Carrier says:

“We don’t owe for chimney flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

IRC requires flashing at all penetrations .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded chimney flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing is required at all penetrations, including chimneys. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .

Q147: Adjuster says:

“We don’t pay for skylight flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

Skylight flashing must be replaced when roof is replaced .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused and must be replaced. The Estimate Request Template addresses this correction .

Q148: Homeowner asks:

“Why do you need to cite code in the estimate?”

Short Answer (with source):

Code citations make corrections undeniable .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

We cite building code in our estimate corrections because it eliminates subjectivity. Carriers cannot deny items required by law. The Estimate Request Template ensures each correction is supported by code .

Q149: Carrier says:

“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF requires starter strips at eaves/rakes for wind warranty .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind warranty. The Estimate Request Template ensures these are included .

Q150: Adjuster says:

“We don’t cover ridge caps.”

Short Answer (with source):

Ridge caps must be replaced when slopes are replaced .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reused. The Estimate Request Template corrects this omission .

Q151: Question:

When should the iTel Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when shingles/siding are discontinued and repairs would cause mismatches .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The iTel Template is used whenever a carrier suggests patching, but iTel testing confirms the shingles or siding are discontinued. By citing iTel’s lab analysis and the Discontinued Shingle List, it proves no suitable replacement exists and full replacement is required .

Q152: Adjuster says:

“We found similar shingles available.”

Short Answer (with source):

iTel confirmed no match exists; mixing voids manufacturer warranty .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested similar shingles are available. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued with no acceptable match. Installing mismatched shingles violates manufacturer warranty and reduces property value. Full replacement is required .

Q153: Carrier says:

“Metric shingles can replace English dimension.”

Short Answer (with source):

Metric and English shingles misalign; sealant strips won’t bond .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested metric shingles can replace English-dimension shingles. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, dimensions differ and prevent proper sealant alignment. This misalignment voids warranty and fails to restore pre-loss condition .

Q154: Homeowner asks:

“Why can’t you just mix old and new shingles?”

Short Answer (with source):

Mixing creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant alignment .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Mixing discontinued shingles with new ones creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant placement. These differences compromise wind resistance and void manufacturer warranty. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms no compatible products are available .

Q155: Adjuster says:

“We’ll only replace damaged shingles, not full slope.”

Short Answer (with source):

iTel confirms discontinued; partial replacement isn’t possible .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed replacing only visibly damaged shingles. The attached iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued. Since replacements cannot match, partial repairs would be defective. Full slope replacement is the only solution .

Q156: Carrier says:

“We can still patch siding with a close match.”

Short Answer (with source):

Close match isn’t acceptable; iTel confirms discontinued siding .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested patching siding with a close match. The iTel analysis confirms the siding is discontinued and no match exists. Mismatched siding reduces property value and violates Maryland matching regulations .

Q157: Homeowner asks:

“What is an iTel report?”

Short Answer (with source):

iTel is a lab test confirming material type and availability .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

An iTel report is a laboratory analysis of a material sample (shingle, siding, etc.). It confirms product type, manufacturer, and whether it is still available. If discontinued, it provides written proof repairs are not feasible .

Q158: Carrier says:

“We don’t accept iTel reports.”

Short Answer (with source):

iTel is independent lab analysis widely accepted in the industry .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said you don’t accept iTel reports. iTel is an independent laboratory used nationwide to confirm product availability. Its results are recognized across the industry and provide objective proof of discontinuation .

Q159: Adjuster says:

“Shingles look available at Home Depot.”

Short Answer (with source):

Retail stores don’t confirm compatibility; iTel confirms discontinuation .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated similar shingles appear in retail stores. Availability at retail does not guarantee dimensional compatibility. The iTel report confirms the original shingles are discontinued and no suitable match exists .

Q160: Homeowner asks:

“Why does discontinued matter if roof still works?”

Short Answer (with source):

Discontinued means no repairs possible without mismatching .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

If shingles are discontinued, no replacements match in size, color, or sealant alignment. This makes repairs impossible without mismatching. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms when a roof system can no longer be patched, requiring full replacement .

Q161: Carrier says:

“We’ll approve repair, not replacement, despite iTel.”

Short Answer (with source):

iTel proves repairs impossible; replacement is required .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved repair despite iTel findings. The iTel report proves the product is discontinued, making repairs impossible without mismatches. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .

Q162: Adjuster says:

“We’ll blend different shingle lots.”

Short Answer (with source):

Lot variations cause color mismatch; iTel confirms no true match .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested blending different lots of shingles. Lot variations cause visible color mismatches, and per the iTel report, the original shingles are discontinued. No blending can restore uniformity. Full replacement is required .

Q163: Carrier says:

“Discontinued list isn’t proof.”

Short Answer (with source):

Discontinued list + iTel lab analysis confirm unavailability .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed the discontinued list. The combination of the iTel lab report and the Discontinued Shingle List provides conclusive proof that the product is unavailable. Together, these establish irreparability .

Q164: Homeowner asks:

“Why can’t you just re-use old shingles?”

Short Answer (with source):

Old shingles crack when lifted; repair attempt shows brittleness .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Reusing old shingles isn’t possible because once lifted, they crack or fail to reseal. Our repair attempt video documents brittleness. Combined with discontinued status, reuse is not feasible .

Q165: Adjuster says:

“New manufacturer products are close enough.”

Short Answer (with source):

Mixing brands violates warranty and reduces property value .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed using a different manufacturer’s product. Mixing brands voids warranty and creates mismatches in size and color. The iTel report confirms no acceptable alternative exists .

Q166: Carrier says:

“We’ll pay for only a few discontinued panels.”

Short Answer (with source):

Partial payment ignores irreparability proven by iTel .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve offered to pay for a few discontinued panels. The iTel report proves no matches exist, so partial repairs aren’t feasible. Full replacement is required .

Q167: Homeowner asks:

“How does iTel help my claim?”

Short Answer (with source):

It provides third-party proof repairs aren’t possible .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

An iTel report is powerful because it’s a third-party lab test confirming discontinuation. Insurance companies must consider it credible evidence that repairs are not possible. It directly supports full replacement .

Q168: Adjuster says:

“We don’t need third-party verification.”

Short Answer (with source):

iTel provides unbiased lab confirmation; not contractor opinion .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed iTel verification. Unlike contractor opinion, iTel is unbiased lab testing. It confirms material discontinuation in an objective, industry-accepted format .

Q169: Carrier says:

“We’ll allow repair with different dimensions.”

Short Answer (with source):

Mixing dimensions misaligns sealant strips; unsafe .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve allowed repairs with different dimension shingles. The Discontinued Shingle List shows English vs. metric sizes do not align, leaving sealant strips misaligned and vulnerable. Repairs are unsafe; full replacement is required .

Q170: Homeowner asks:

“Can insurance force me to accept mismatched materials?”

Short Answer (with source):

No — insurance must restore pre-loss condition, not partial repairs .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

No, insurance cannot force mismatched repairs. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding and roofing are not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in policy. You’re entitled to full replacement .

Q171: Adjuster says:

“We’ll just caulk or seal damaged shingles.”

Short Answer (with source):

Caulking is not manufacturer-approved repair; voids warranty .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed caulking damaged shingles. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, caulking is not an approved repair method and voids warranty. Replacement is required .

Q172: Carrier says:

“We won’t accept discontinued list as evidence.”

Short Answer (with source):

Discontinued list + iTel confirm no replacement available .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed the discontinued list. When paired with iTel lab testing, the Discontinued Shingle List confirms no suitable replacement is available. Together, they provide conclusive proof .

Q173: Homeowner asks:

“What happens if we can’t match?”

Short Answer (with source):

Code and regulations require full replacement when mismatching .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

If a match isn’t possible, full replacement is required. Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 confirms that mismatched siding or roofing isn’t acceptable unless excluded in the policy .

Q174: Adjuster says:

“We can reuse discontinued shingles from repair stock.”

Short Answer (with source):

Stored shingles won’t align in color/age; still discontinued .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested using repair stock. Even if a few discontinued shingles exist in storage, they will differ in color, age, and sealant ability. The Discontinued Shingle List confirms they are no longer viable for repairs .

Q175: Carrier says:

“We’ll patch siding with leftover stock.”

Short Answer (with source):

Leftover siding won’t match aged/weathered walls; iTel confirms discontinued .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested using leftover siding stock. These pieces won’t match weathered siding on the home, and the iTel report confirms the line is discontinued. Patching with leftovers does not restore pre-loss condition .

Q176: Question:

When should the Arbitration Template be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when carrier denies all appeals and homeowner seeks neutral review .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

The Arbitration Template should be used when all internal appeals with the insurance company have been exhausted and the carrier maintains denial. It initiates a neutral review process where an arbitrator evaluates the dispute. This forces the carrier to defend their denial against documented evidence .

Q177: Carrier says:

“Denial is final and not appealable.”

Short Answer (with source):

Arbitration is a valid escalation option under policy rights .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated the denial is final. Per the Arbitration Information template, the policyholder maintains the right to escalate unresolved disputes through arbitration. This process ensures fair claim handling beyond internal review .

Q178: Homeowner asks:

“What is arbitration?”

Short Answer (with source):

Arbitration is a neutral third-party review of the claim .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Arbitration is when a neutral third-party arbitrator reviews the evidence from both sides — homeowner and carrier — and makes a binding or advisory decision. It’s an escalation step if the carrier refuses to honor valid claim documentation .

Q179: Carrier says:

“Arbitration doesn’t apply here.”

Short Answer (with source):

If policy includes arbitration, carrier must participate .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed arbitration. If the policy includes arbitration provisions, the carrier must participate once properly initiated. The Arbitration Information template provides standardized language to enforce this right .

Q180: Homeowner asks:

“Why use arbitration instead of lawsuit?”

Short Answer (with source):

Arbitration is faster, cheaper, and still binding .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Arbitration avoids the delays and costs of lawsuits while still offering neutral review. It’s faster, more affordable, and often binding depending on policy terms. The Arbitration Template helps initiate this option effectively .

Q181: Question:

When should Complaint Forms be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when carrier mishandles claim or refuses fair handling .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Complaint Forms should be used when an insurance company delays, denies, or mishandles a claim unfairly. Filing with the state insurance administration creates oversight and pressures carriers to comply with fair claims practices .

Q182: Carrier says:

“Will filing a complaint hurt my claim?”

Short Answer (with source):

“We don’t recognize state complaints.”

Short Answer (with source):

Carriers are required by law to respond to complaints .

Q187: Question:

When should both Arbitration and Complaint Forms be used?

Short Answer (with source):

Use when carrier refuses reconsideration and claim is unresolved .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Both Arbitration and Complaint Forms should be used when a carrier refuses reconsideration despite documentation. Arbitration applies policy provisions for neutral review, while complaints trigger state oversight. Together, they maximize pressure for resolution .

Q188: Homeowner asks:

“Which should I do first: arbitration or complaint?”

Short Answer (with source):

Complaint first for oversight; arbitration if still unresolved .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Generally, filing a complaint first is recommended because it creates regulatory oversight. If the carrier still refuses, then proceed to arbitration. Both paths are valid, but this order applies the most pressure .

Q189: Carrier says:

“We won’t change claim regardless of oversight.”

Short Answer (with source):

Oversight and arbitration hold carriers accountable by law .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated oversight won’t affect your decision. State regulators and arbitration provisions exist specifically to hold carriers accountable. Ignoring either is a violation of fair claim handling .

“We won’t respond to arbitration.”

Short Answer (with source):

Policy provisions require participation once initiated .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said you won’t respond to arbitration. If arbitration is written into the policy, the carrier is contractually obligated to participate. Refusal breaches policy terms .

Q192: Adjuster says:

“Arbitration is just advisory.”

Short Answer (with source):

Many arbitration decisions are binding per policy terms .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said arbitration is advisory only. Many policies make arbitration binding. Even when advisory, arbitrators’ decisions strongly influence resolution. The Arbitration Template enforces this right .

Q193: Homeowner asks:

“What if complaint doesn’t work?”

Short Answer (with source):

Proceed to arbitration or escalate legally .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

If a complaint doesn’t resolve the issue, the next step is arbitration or legal escalation. Complaints create oversight, but arbitration provides binding or advisory resolution if denial persists .

“Customer has no further rights.”

Short Answer (with source):

Customer has right to complaint, arbitration, and legal action .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Complaints enforce fair handling, not damage proof .
