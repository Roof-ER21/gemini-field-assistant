# Virginia Roofing Law Overview (Quick Reference)

Audience: S21 (Susan) and Roof-ER field reps. Use as quick, non-legal guidance. Confirm with local AHJ.

Key Points
- Building Code: Virginia Construction Code (VCC) based on 2021 ICC codes (local adoption applies)
- Matching: Not mandated by state law by default. Only applies if policy has a matching endorsement.
- Strategy: Focus on repairability, brittleness tests, documented failed repair attempts, and code-compliant methods.
- Permits: Many jurisdictions require permits for roofing; verify local requirements and inspections.
- Licensing: Contractor license (Class A/B/C as applicable) + any local registrations.

Use Cases
- Partial approvals: Avoid “matching” as primary argument unless specific endorsement exists; prefer repairability and code compliance arguments.
- Documentation: Photos, measurements, manufacturer guidance (e.g., shingle dimensions, discontinued lines), and failed repair attempts.

Disclaimer: This is general guidance. Confirm with local officials and policy language.
