Filming Repair Attempt Video

Before you begin filming, ask the Field Tech (Francisco or Ishmael) to point out which of the surrounding shingles will be affected by the extraction. Mark the damaged tab (if applicable) and mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.

Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle. Start recording,  “...Here we are at [HOMEOWNER’S HOUSE] performing a repair attempt on this storm damaged shingle. As you can see I have pre-marked every tab that will sustain unavoidable creasing due to the brittleness of the roof. Go ahead and get started Francisco/Ishmael”

Film the entire area where repair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process. Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount of granule loss running down the roof.

Once the new shingle has been installed, hover the camera over the shingles and wipe your hand back and forth gently over the top of each tab that was pried up. Trace your finger along the crease and show it on camera, explain how each tab has now been mechanically creased and confirms the roof failed a “brittle test”.

Once you have finished recording your video. Take close-up after pictures of the browns above the replaced shingle. Draw an arrow to where the crease is on the shingle or point to it for the picture.

Checklist for Post-Adjuster Meeting

Photo Report Complete

Upload photo report from photos tab when you have good reception

Hover Complete

Move Job File

Most jobs should go to Estimate Pending (make sure to look at next item on this check list - very important when moving a job to Estimate Pending)

Jobs that you think are partial or denial will be moved to Decision Pending

Note: This is the ONLY time you move a job

Post-Adjuster Meeting Script

Read it to your customer if you have to - much better than missing something

Main emphasis should be for them to send you the estimate once they receive it

Post-Adjuster Meeting Email

Please send Claim Authorization (and photo report when needed) to the adjuster after the AM.  Start with the Post AM Email Template

Please make sure all of these things are complete before the end of the day of an Adjuster Meeting

Partials/Reinspects/Moving jobs

See above for when you should move a job to Decision Pending or Estimate Pending

A job will be automatically moved for you after you submit the full approval, partial estimate, or denial letter (Do not move the job yourself to another stage here!)

For your jobs that are partial or denials - they will automatically be moved to one of two stages:

Partial - Approval

Reinspection - Request Pending

Once your job is moved and you have a clear plan, make sure to execute

iTel

RA

Reinspect

Customer Complaint Form

Etc

Once you complete one of the above tasks:

If your job was in Partial - Approval, move job to Partial Pending - which will let the customer know that you have sent in your arguments and are awaiting additional communication or potentially an updated estimate to full approval

If your job was in Reinspection-Request Pending and the adjuster has confirmed they will be scheduling a reinspect, move job to Reinspection Pending

Once the reinspection has happened, ensure the same tasks that are listed under the Checklist for Post-Adjuster Meeting are completed

In most cases, the only item not completed there yet would be moving the job back to Decision or Estimate Pending
