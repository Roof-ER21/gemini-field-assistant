# 📧 Email Generator 

📧 Email Generator button could work in practice if it were built into the Roof-ER field app:

⸻

1. User Flow

•	Click Button: Rep taps 📧 Email Generator.

•	Prompt Screen: A simple form opens asking:

•	Who’s the email for? (Homeowner, Adjuster, Insurance Desk, Escalation/Complaint)

•	Claim number (auto-fill if already in job file)

•	Attachments? (Photo Report, iTel, Repair Attempt, Discontinued Shingle List, COI, etc.)

•	Key notes / custom message.

⸻

2. Template Selection

The system pulls from Roof-ER’s preloaded Word templates (e.g., Repair Attempt, Partial, Estimate Request, Siding Argument, Customer-to-Insurance) and auto-formats them into email text.

⸻

3. Auto-Population

•	Homeowner Emails: Friendly updates in plain language, like confirming inspection or next steps.

•	Adjuster Emails: Professional tone with supporting docs (Photo Report, Code references, GAF guidelines).

•	Carrier/Insurance Emails: Formal, using compliance language and escalation if needed (matching laws, arbitration rights, complaint forms).

Each email would auto-fill:

•	Homeowner name & address

•	Claim number & carrier

•	Rep’s signature (name, phone, email, Roof-ER info)

⸻

4. Smart Attachments

System recommends what to attach:

•	Repair Attempt → attach Repair Attempt Template + Photo Report.

•	Partial Denial → attach Generic Partial Template + GAF Guidelines.

•	Siding → attach Siding Argument + Code reference.

•	Escalation → attach Complaint Form + Arbitration doc.

⸻

5. Final Step

•	Preview email before sending.

•	Option to send direct from app or copy text into Gmail/Outlook.

•	Confirmation saved to job file for tracking.

⸻

👉 Essentially, the Email Generator would turn your templates + claim data into ready-to-send, professional emails in seconds — so reps don’t waste time rewriting the same points.

Email Generator — Example Flow

Step 1: Rep Chooses Options

Recipient: Adjuster

Situation: Partial Denial (only slope approved, others denied)

Claim #: 12345678

Homeowner: John & Mary Smith

Carrier: State Farm

Attachments: Photo Report, GAF Guidelines, Discontinued Shingle List

Step 2: Email Output (Auto-Generated)

Subject: Claim #12345678 — Full Roof Replacement Required (Smith Residence)

Body:

Hello [Adjuster Name],

I am writing regarding the above-referenced claim for John & Mary Smith at [address]. We appreciate your approval of the [approved slope], but respectfully must point out why full replacement is required for this roof system.

Manufacturer Requirements: Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, partial replacements compromise roof integrity and void manufacturer warranty.

Building Code Compliance: [If applicable, system inserts state code reference — e.g., VA slope requirement, MD matching law.]

Material Availability: The insured’s shingles are discontinued (see attached Discontinued Shingle List). Mixing product lines is prohibited per manufacturer.

Uniform Appearance: Industry standards (HAAG, NAIC) require uniformity — patching or partial replacement would result in a mismatched roof system.

For these reasons, we request full approval of all slopes. Supporting documentation and photos are attached for review.

Please confirm receipt and next steps.

Best regards,
