Roof-ER Top 10 Quick Facts Cheat Sheet
1. Failed Repair = Full Replacement:
If shingles crack/break during manipulation (brittle test), repairs are not possible.
Use Repair Attempt Template.
2. Discontinued Shingles:
Use GAF's discontinued list or iTel to prove repairs cannot be blended.
Mixing old/new is not acceptable.
3. Slope Rule (Virginia):
Asphalt shingles only allowed on slopes 2/12 or greater.
Flatter slopes must use flat roof system.
4. Siding Replacement (Maryland):
Per code, housewrap & barrier required.
Replacement of siding is often unavoidable due to code + mismatch issues.
5. Flashing:
Code requires replacing damaged/rusted flashings.
Insurance cannot demand reuse.
6. Storm Damage = Replacement:
GAF states latent hail/wind damage (granule loss, cracks, mat exposure)
leads to roof failure.
Patch repairs not reliable.
7. Partial Approvals:
GAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes
requires full replacement of adjoining sections.
8. Insurance Weather Data:
Always ask which source they used.
Counter with iTel or HailTrace reports.
9. Mismatch (Maryland):
Bulletin 18-23 requires insurers to address shade/texture mismatch.
Elsewhere, argue loss of value + discontinued product.
10. Escalation Path:
(1) Template → (2) Code/Manufacturer Support → (3) Homeowner Complaint
→ (4) Arbitration/Appraisal if needed.
