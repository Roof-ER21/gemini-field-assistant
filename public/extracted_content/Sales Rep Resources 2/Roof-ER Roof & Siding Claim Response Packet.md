Attached are:
• Photo report documenting roof damage

• GAF manufacturer guidelines recommending full replacement
• Building code references on slope and flashing

Because patch repair is not feasible due to material discontinuation, manufacturer requirements, and code compliance, the only way to restore [CUSTOMER NAME]’s property is full roof replacement.

Please review these findings and provide a revised estimate accordingly.

🛠 Repair Attempt / Brittle Test Argument

Repair attempt photos/videos show shingles cracking during manipulation. This confirms a failed brittle test and irreparability, requiring full replacement.

📑 Discontinued Shingle / iTel Argument

iTel report confirms shingles are discontinued. Suggested alternatives are incompatible in size, require bulk orders, or do not bond correctly with existing shingles. Patch repair is not viable.

🏭 GAF Manufacturer Guidelines

GAF Storm Damage Guidelines (TAB-R-2011-126): If more than 2–3 shingles per plane are damaged, complete replacement is recommended.

GAF Slope Replacement Bulletin (TAB-R-164, 2024): Replacing a single plane requires full removal of underlayment and ridge/hip connections. This reinforces the need for full section replacement.

📏 Building Code Arguments

Virginia Code R905.2.2: Asphalt shingles permitted only on slopes ≥2/12. Lower slopes require flat/low-slope systems.

Flashing Code 908.5: Rusted/damaged flashing must be replaced. Reuse of old flashing is not permitted.

🏡 Siding Claim Response

📧 Cover Email to Adjuster/Insurance

Subject: Claim # [Insert Claim #] – Siding Scope Revision Request

To Whom It May Concern,

This is [REP NAME] with Roof-ER. I am assisting [CUSTOMER NAME].

Attached are:
• Photo report documenting siding damage
• iTel report confirming siding is discontinued
• Code references requiring proper housewrap and flashing

Because the siding is discontinued and repairs would cause consequential damage, patch repair is not a cost-effective or code-compliant solution. The only way to restore [CUSTOMER NAME]’s property is full siding replacement.

Please review these findings and provide a revised estimate accordingly.

📑 Discontinued Siding Argument

iTel report confirms siding is discontinued. Available substitutes require special orders and paint matching, which are not cost-effective or compliant. Only full siding replacement restores the home.

📏 Code Requirement Argument

Maryland IRC R703.2 & R703.4: Requires continuous water-resistant barrier and proper flashing. Housewrap must overlap at corners, requiring removal of adjacent siding. This causes consequential damage, making patch repair impractical.

Virginia ICC Code: Damaged siding cannot be reinstalled.

☑ iTel Report
☑ Discontinued Shingle/Siding List

⚖ Escalation Steps (Roof or Siding)

1. Have homeowner send the 'Customer to Insurance' template email.

3. Arbitration may be an option, but only if mutually agreed.
