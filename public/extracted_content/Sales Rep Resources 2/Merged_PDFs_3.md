Arbitration Information
Binding Arbitration
Legally enforceable like a court decision.
Both parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.
No appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).
Once the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.
Example: An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via
binding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that
amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.
Non-Binding Arbitration
The arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.
Either party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.
Often used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.
Example: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and
decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.
Important for Insurance Claims:
Binding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.
Most policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.
Virginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it —
it can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.
