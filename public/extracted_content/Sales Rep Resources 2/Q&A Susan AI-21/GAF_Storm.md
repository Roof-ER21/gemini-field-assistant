“Sealant strips can be resealed.”

Short Answer (with source):

Resealing isn’t manufacturer-approved; GAF requires replacement .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed resealing shingles. Per GAF guidelines, resealing is not an approved repair. Once a sealant strip fails, replacement is required to maintain warranty and performance .

Q203: Carrier says:

“Granule loss is cosmetic only.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF confirms granule loss exposes asphalt mat, accelerating failure .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed granule loss as cosmetic. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granules protect shingles from UV and weather. Loss exposes the asphalt mat, accelerates aging, and voids warranty. Replacement is required .

Q204: Adjuster says:

“Bruises don’t affect roof function.”

Short Answer (with source):

Bruising cracks asphalt mat, weakening waterproofing .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed hail bruises. Per GAF, hail bruising fractures the asphalt mat and loosens granules, weakening waterproofing. This constitutes functional damage requiring replacement .

Q205: Carrier says:

“Missing shingles can be spot repaired.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF requires full slope replacement if shingles are discontinued .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said missing shingles can be spot repaired. If the shingles are discontinued, per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, full slope replacement is required. Repairs with mismatched shingles are not permitted .

Q206: Homeowner asks:

“Why does manufacturer guideline matter to my claim?”

Short Answer (with source):

Manufacturer requirements protect warranty and system integrity .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Manufacturer guidelines are critical because they define what’s required for your roof to perform properly and remain under warranty. Carriers must follow these guidelines when approving claims .

“Manufacturer guidelines don’t control claims.”

Short Answer (with source):

They control warranty and installation — both apply to claims .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated guidelines don’t apply to claims. Manufacturer requirements control warranty validity and installation standards. Carriers must meet both to restore pre-loss condition .

Q224: Carrier says:

“Cosmetic storm damage isn’t covered.”

Short Answer (with source):

Damage like granule loss, creasing, bruises = functional per GAF .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed storm damage as cosmetic. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, impacts like granule loss, creases, and bruises are functional damages that accelerate failure. Coverage must apply .

Q225: Homeowner asks:

“How do you prove damage to insurance?”

Short Answer (with source):

Through repair attempts, iTel reports, photo reports, and GAF standards .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

We prove damage with multiple forms of evidence: repair attempts showing irreparability, iTel reports confirming discontinuation, photo reports documenting impacts, and GAF standards validating functional damage. Together, these establish the claim .

Q226: Carrier says:

“Half-slope repairs are acceptable.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF requires full-slope replacement; half-slope repairs void warranty .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated half-slope repairs are acceptable. Per GAF slope replacement requirements, partial slope repairs create mismatches and void warranty. Full slope replacement is required to comply with manufacturer standards .

Q227: Adjuster says:

“Warranty doesn’t affect insurance.”

Short Answer (with source):

Warranty void leaves property below pre-loss condition .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed warranty impact. A roof without warranty is not restored to pre-loss condition. Per GAF, storm-damaged or improperly repaired shingles void warranty. Insurance must cover replacement .

Q228: Carrier says:

“We’ll patch with whatever’s available.”

Short Answer (with source):

Mixing products violates GAF system requirements .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed patching with non-matching products. Per GAF, roofing is a system — mixing products voids warranty and fails to restore performance. Replacement with matching materials is required .

Q229: Homeowner asks:

“Why can’t we just replace a few shingles?”

Short Answer (with source):

Replacement voids warranty if shingles don’t match .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Replacing just a few shingles leaves mismatches and voids warranty. Per GAF slope replacement requirements, entire slopes must be replaced when repairs are not possible with matching materials .

Q230: Adjuster says:

“Granule loss isn’t functional damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Granule loss exposes asphalt, accelerating roof failure .

Q232: Homeowner asks:

“Why is matching important?”

Short Answer (with source):

Mismatch voids warranty and lowers property value .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

Matching is important because mismatched shingles void manufacturer warranty and lower property value. Per GAF slope replacement rules, repairs must restore full slope with matching products .

Q233: Adjuster says:

“Only leaks prove damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF confirms non-leaking storm damage is still functional .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said only leaks prove damage. Per GAF, wind creases, sealant failures, and bruises are functional damage even if no leak is present. Waiting for leaks ignores real, documented storm damage .

Q234: Carrier says:

“Repairs are cheaper than replacement.”

Short Answer (with source):

Repairs with discontinued shingles aren’t feasible; replacement required .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said repairs are cheaper. Repairs with discontinued shingles are not feasible, and per GAF slope requirements, full replacement is the only code- and warranty-compliant option .

Q235: Homeowner asks:

“Why is manufacturer warranty important?”

Short Answer (with source):

Warranty ensures long-term protection; ignoring voids it .

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested resealing wind-lifted shingles. Per GAF, resealing isn’t an approved method. Replacement is required to maintain roof integrity and warranty .

Q264: Carrier says:

“One slope repair is sufficient.”

Short Answer (with source):

Storm affected multiple slopes; partial repair is inadequate .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved only one slope. Our generic partial template and photo report show storm damage across multiple slopes. Full replacement is required for all impacted areas .

Q265: Homeowner asks:

“Why do you document slopes separately?”

Short Answer (with source):

Each slope may show unique storm impacts .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

We document slopes separately because storm damage can vary by slope due to wind direction and hail patterns. Our photo report template ensures each slope’s damage is clearly documented .

Q266: Adjuster says:

“Gutter damage doesn’t prove roof damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Collateral confirms storm severity and supports claim .

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said gutter damage doesn’t prove roof damage. Collateral impacts are industry-standard proof of storm severity and direction, supporting roof replacement claims .

Q267: Carrier says:

“We don’t pay for collateral.”

Short Answer (with source):

Collateral proves storm event; part of total claim .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied collateral coverage. Collateral (gutters, vents, metals) proves storm event and is part of the overall claim. Excluding it ignores valid storm impacts .

Q268: Homeowner asks:

“Why take so many photos?”

Short Answer (with source):

Photos create permanent, objective record of damage .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

We take photos to create a permanent, objective record of storm damage. Even if adjusters miss items, the photo report captures evidence for the claim .

Q269: Adjuster says:

“Mat bruises won’t cause leaks.”

Short Answer (with source):

Bruises fracture asphalt mat; shorten roof life .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed mat bruises. Per GAF, hail bruises fracture the asphalt mat beneath granules. This weakens waterproofing and accelerates roof failure, requiring replacement .

Q270: Carrier says:

“Wind creases can be sealed.”

Short Answer (with source):

Creases weaken shingles permanently; not repairable .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve said creases can be sealed. Per GAF guidelines, creases break the fiberglass mat and weaken the shingle permanently. Sealant doesn’t restore strength; replacement required .

Q271: Homeowner asks:

“Why document bruises if no leaks yet?”

Short Answer (with source):

Bruises shorten life and void warranty .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

We document bruises even without leaks because they shorten roof life and void manufacturer warranty. Per GAF, bruises are functional damage requiring replacement .

Q272: Adjuster says:

“Sealant damage is normal aging.”

Short Answer (with source):

Storm-caused sealant failure differs from aging .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve called sealant failure normal aging. Per GAF, storm-caused sealant failure shows distinct patterns, unlike slow deterioration. These are functional storm damages .

Q273: Carrier says:

“We don’t owe for slope with few hits.”

Short Answer (with source):

Even few hits per slope = replacement per GAF .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded a slope with “few hits.” Per GAF guidelines, even limited hits compromise slope integrity and void warranty. Replacement required for that slope .

Q274: Homeowner asks:

“How many hail hits = replacement?”

Short Answer (with source):

No set number; any functional hits justify replacement .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

There’s no universal number of hits required. If hail causes functional damage — bruises, cracks, granule loss — then replacement is warranted per GAF. Even a few hits can justify full slope replacement .

Q275: Adjuster says:

“Wind-lifted shingles can be hand-sealed.”

Short Answer (with source):

Hand-sealing isn’t GAF-approved repair .

Detailed Answer (Training Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed hand-sealing lifted shingles. Per GAF guidelines, this method isn’t approved. Lifted shingles lose integrity and require replacement .

Q276: Carrier says:

“We don’t cover flashing replacement.”

Short Answer (with source):

Flashing must be replaced when disturbed during reroofing .
