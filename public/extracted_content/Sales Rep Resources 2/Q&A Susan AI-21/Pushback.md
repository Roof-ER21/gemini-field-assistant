Insurance Pushback & Arguments Playbook (Q1–Q100)

Q1: Adjuster says:

“We don’t see enough damage to warrant replacement.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our photo report shows functional storm damage (creases, missing shingles) beyond repair. This requires full replacement .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Please see the attached photo report documenting storm-related damage on multiple slopes. The photos clearly show creased and missing shingles, which are consistent with functional wind damage and cannot be repaired without causing further harm. Per standard industry practice, this constitutes irreparability, and a full replacement is required to restore the property to its pre-loss condition. We respectfully request that your estimate be revised accordingly .

Q2: Adjuster says:

“Hail is cosmetic and doesn’t affect function.”

Short Answer (with source):

Hail damage is not cosmetic — it causes granule loss, mat fractures, and sealant bond failures, per GAF .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial states that hail damage is cosmetic only. However, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, hail impact causes functional issues such as granule loss, cracks in the asphalt mat, and compromised sealant bonds. These defects accelerate roof deterioration and shorten lifespan, making the roof irreparable. For these reasons, this damage cannot be dismissed as cosmetic. Please update your estimate to reflect full roof replacement .

Q3: Carrier says:

“Shingles can be patched.”

Short Answer (with source):

The iTel report confirms the shingles are discontinued; patching would cause mismatches and fail manufacturer standards .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your position that the roof can be patched is not consistent with the findings of the attached iTel report, which confirms that the installed shingles are discontinued. Per the Discontinued Shingle List, no comparable replacements exist. Mixing discontinued shingles with available alternatives creates mismatches in size, color, and sealant bond, violating manufacturer standards. The only viable and code-compliant option is full replacement .

Q4: Adjuster says:

“We don’t see storm-related damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our photo report documents collateral and shingle damage consistent with the reported storm event. Latent storm damage may not be immediately visible .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial states no storm-related damage was found. Please review the attached photo report, which documents collateral impacts to gutters, soft metals, and shingles. These damage patterns are consistent with the storm event reported and align with industry-recognized storm signatures. Additionally, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, latent damage from wind or hail may not be visible immediately but still compromises long-term performance. We ask that the scope be reconsidered with this evidence in mind .

Q5: Carrier says:

“The roof is still functional.”

Short Answer (with source):

Coverage isn’t based on functionality — cracked shingles and exposed mats void warranties and require replacement .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

While you noted the roof is “still functional,” coverage is not determined by whether a roof is currently leaking but by restoring the property to its pre-loss condition. The attached documentation shows cracked shingles and exposed fiberglass mats. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, these conditions void the manufacturer’s warranty and compromise the integrity of the system. Repair is not feasible, and replacement is required to bring the property back to pre-storm condition .

Q6: Adjuster says:

“We won’t cover storm tarp nail holes.”

Short Answer (with source):

Per GAF, tarping through shingles permanently damages them. Caulking nail holes is not an acceptable repair .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes coverage for tarp-related nail holes. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, any roof that has been nailed through during tarping has been permanently compromised. Caulking these penetrations is not a permanent repair and creates a maintenance issue outside warranty coverage. The shingles with nail holes must be replaced to ensure a watertight system .

Q7: Carrier says:

“Damage is old, not storm-related.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our timestamped photo report shows fresh granule loss and collateral consistent with the reported storm .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial suggests the roof damage is due to age. However, the attached photo report includes timestamped documentation of fresh granule loss, creased shingles, and collateral damage consistent with the recent storm. Natural wear appears uniformly over time, while storm damage is localized and patterned. These conditions confirm storm-related damage .

Q8: Adjuster says:

“Denial stands, no additional inspection.”

Short Answer (with source):

The homeowner may request a second inspection and has provided new documentation .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

We respectfully request a second inspection on behalf of the homeowner. The customer-to-insurance template letter has been provided and highlights overlooked damage supported by our documentation. Denying reinspection ignores the policyholder’s right to fair claim handling. Please reconsider based on this new evidence .

Q9: Carrier says:

“No damage to soft metals = no hail event.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our photo report shows dents in metals. Even without collateral, GAF confirms hail causes latent shingle damage .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You denied hail damage based on an absence of collateral. The attached photo report shows visible dents to soft metals. Furthermore, per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, shingles can sustain latent damage (fractures, granule loss, bond failures) even without collateral evidence. The absence of extensive metal damage does not rule out functional hail damage to shingles .

Q10: Adjuster says:

“Your test was unnecessary.”

Short Answer (with source):

The brittle test is industry standard. Our video shows shingles cracked during manipulation, proving irreparability .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Our brittle test was necessary to confirm whether repair was feasible. The documented repair attempt video shows the shingles fractured during manipulation, a clear indicator of irreparability. This aligns with accepted industry standards for testing storm-damaged shingles. Repair is not possible; full replacement is the only solution .

Q11: Carrier says:

“Your documentation isn’t sufficient.”

Short Answer (with source):

We’ve provided photo report, repair attempt, and iTel report — proving irreparability and discontinuation .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You stated our documentation is insufficient. Please note we have submitted:

A photo report showing storm-related damage.

A repair attempt video proving irreparability.

An iTel report confirming discontinuation of the shingles.

 Together, these documents establish that the roof cannot be repaired, only replaced .

Q12: Adjuster says:

“The roof is patchable.”

Short Answer (with source):

Mixing discontinued English-dimension shingles with metric shingles misaligns sealant, violating manufacturer standards .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial suggests patching is possible. The attached iTel report confirms the existing shingles are English dimension and discontinued. New shingles are only available in metric sizing, which misaligns sealant strips and prevents proper bonding. Manufacturer installation standards prohibit mixing dimensions, making patching non-viable .

Q13: Carrier says:

“No coverage for siding mismatch.”

Short Answer (with source):

Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23 requires siding replacement unless policy explicitly excludes it .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial of siding mismatch coverage contradicts Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, which requires carriers to provide for siding replacement unless policies specifically exclude matching. The damaged siding is discontinued, and no suitable matches are available. Full elevation replacement is required .

Q14: Adjuster says:

“We only pay Actual Cash Value, not replacement.”

Short Answer (with source):

Replacement cost policies require restoring pre-loss condition. Patch repairs with discontinued shingles don’t qualify .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve indicated coverage is limited to ACV only. This property carries replacement cost coverage, which requires restoring it to pre-loss condition. Since the shingles are discontinued, patch repairs are impossible without mismatching and lowering value. Full replacement is the only way to honor policy terms .

Q15: Carrier says:

“No hail large enough reported.”

Short Answer (with source):

NOAA data and our photos show functional hail damage. Size is irrelevant once damage exists .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial cites no reported hail size sufficient for damage. Our photo report shows functional hail impacts — granule loss, fractures, and collateral dents. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, even small hail can cause latent shingle failure. Coverage must be based on observed damage, not storm reports alone .

Q16: Adjuster says:

“We don’t cover flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

Per VA Code 908.5, damaged or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during re-roofing .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, all rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashings must be replaced when re-roofing. Attempting to reuse old flashings violates code and creates long-term risk. Replacement must be included .

Q17: Carrier says:

“Granule loss is normal aging.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF states storm-related granule loss exposes asphalt and accelerates failure .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial attributes granule loss to aging. Per GAF Storm Damage Guidelines, granule loss from hail or wind exposes the asphalt mat, accelerating deterioration and causing premature failure. This is storm-related functional damage, not normal wear .

Q18: Adjuster says:

“Repairs will hold fine.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our repair attempt already failed — shingles cracked during manipulation .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated repairs will hold. However, our documented repair attempt shows shingles cracking when lifted, confirming brittleness. Repairs would cause further damage and are not viable. Replacement is required .

Q19: Carrier says:

“We don’t pay for collateral damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Collateral (gutters, metals, screens) proves storm impact and supports full replacement .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes collateral. Our photo report documents storm-related impacts to gutters, metals, and siding. Collateral damage proves storm impact, strengthens the claim, and requires coverage to restore the property fully .

Q20: Adjuster says:

“Denial is final.”

Short Answer (with source):

Homeowners may escalate through arbitration or formal complaint forms .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial letter states the decision is final. The homeowner reserves the right to escalate through arbitration or the appropriate state complaint process. We would prefer resolution at this stage and urge reconsideration with the new documentation provided .

Q21: Carrier says:

“We don’t accept contractor reports.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our iTel and photo reports are third-party verified industry standards .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated contractor reports are insufficient. Please note, the iTel report is a third-party laboratory analysis, and our photo report follows standard claim documentation procedures. These are accepted industry documents and valid evidence of storm damage .

Q22: Adjuster says:

“We see no storm date evidence.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our report is timestamped and consistent with NOAA storm data .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial cites no storm date evidence. Our photo report is timestamped and aligns with NOAA storm data for this location and date. The pattern and extent of the damage confirm storm causation .

Q23: Carrier says:

“Your estimate exceeds fair market value.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our estimate includes mandatory code items like flashing and WRB per VA & MD code .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated our estimate exceeds market value. Please note the estimate includes mandatory code items: flashing per VA Code 908.5 and water-resistive barriers per MD Code R703. These are required by law and must be included in the scope .

Q24: Adjuster says:

“We don’t owe for underlayment.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF requires underlayment to overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6″. Reuse isn’t allowed .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes underlayment. Per GAF Slope Replacement Guidelines, when replacing a single plane, underlayment must overlap adjoining slopes by 4–6 inches. Reusing old material is not permitted, and proper installation requires new underlayment .

Q25: Carrier says:

“We won’t reopen this claim.”

Short Answer (with source):

New evidence (repair attempt, iTel, photo report) requires reconsideration .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated the claim cannot be reopened. However, we’ve provided new documentation: a repair attempt video confirming irreparability, an iTel report verifying discontinuation, and a photo report documenting storm damage. This new evidence requires reconsideration under the policyholder’s rights .

Q26: Adjuster says:

“We’ll replace the back slope only, not the entire roof.”

Short Answer (with source):

Per GAF slope replacement requirements, underlayment and ridge/hip work cannot be isolated — full replacement is required .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved only the back slope for replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, replacing a single slope requires removing and overlapping underlayment at ridge and hip connections, which compromises adjoining slopes. This process makes isolated slope replacement impractical and risks system failure. A full replacement is required to maintain roof integrity .

Q27: Carrier says:

“We only saw damage on the front slope.”

Short Answer (with source):

Storms impact all slopes. Our photo report shows consistent collateral across multiple slopes .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your approval of only the front slope does not reflect the actual storm damage. Our attached photo report documents consistent collateral and shingle damage across multiple slopes. Storm exposure is not limited to a single elevation. To restore the property, all slopes must be included .

Q28: Adjuster says:

“Only one siding elevation is covered.”

Short Answer (with source):

Maryland law requires full replacement when matching is impossible .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved only one elevation for siding replacement. Per Maryland Insurance Administration Bulletin 18-23, mismatched siding is not acceptable unless explicitly excluded in the policy. The damaged siding is discontinued, and matching is impossible. Full elevation replacement is required .

Q29: Carrier says:

“We don’t see gutter damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Photo report shows collateral gutter impacts consistent with roof damage .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial omits gutters. Our photo report documents dents and granule washout in the gutters consistent with roof storm damage. Collateral gutter damage confirms storm impact and must be included in the scope .

Q30: Adjuster says:

“We won’t cover downspouts.”

Short Answer (with source):

Downspouts show hail dents and granule buildup. They are storm-damaged and must be replaced .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes downspouts. Our attached photo documentation shows clear hail dents and granule buildup at downspout terminations. These are storm-related damages that shorten system life. Replacement is required to restore pre-loss condition .

Q31: Carrier says:

“We’ll approve roof but not siding.”

Short Answer (with source):

Storm caused both roof and siding damage. Code and matching requirements apply .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved roof replacement but denied siding. The storm impacted both systems. Per our siding argument documentation and Maryland matching requirements, partial siding replacement creates mismatches and fails to restore the home properly. Siding must be included .

Q32: Adjuster says:

“Only approving half of siding wall.”

Short Answer (with source):

Removing corner posts requires detaching full wall, causing consequential damage .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve limited siding replacement to half a wall. Per our siding argument documentation, removing corner posts and reinstalling panels causes consequential damage that requires full wall replacement. Partial approval is not feasible .

Q33: Carrier says:

“We only cover wind-damaged shingles, not hail.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our photo report documents both hail and wind impacts; both require coverage .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve covered wind damage but excluded hail. The attached photo report documents both creased shingles (wind) and circular divots with granule loss (hail). Per GAF Storm Guidelines, hail damage is functional, not cosmetic. Both perils must be covered .

Q34: Adjuster says:

“We’ll cover roof but not flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

VA Code requires flashing replacement when deteriorated or rusted .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes flashing. Per Virginia Building Code 908.5, any rusted, damaged, or deteriorated flashing must be replaced during reroofing. Code compliance requires flashing be included in the scope .

Q35: Carrier says:

“No siding wrap needed.”

Short Answer (with source):

Maryland Code R703 requires WRB behind siding .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded housewrap. Per Maryland Exterior Wall Code R703, a water-resistive barrier must be installed behind siding. Omitting this violates code and risks moisture intrusion. WRB must be included .

Q36: Adjuster says:

“We’ll cover slope but not ridge cap.”

Short Answer (with source):

Replacing a slope requires ridge cap removal; reuse voids manufacturer standards .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved slope replacement but excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed during slope replacement and cannot be reinstalled without voiding warranty. Ridge caps must be included .

Q37: Carrier says:

“We’ll cover roof but not underlayment.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF requires new underlayment overlap when replacing slopes .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied underlayment. Per GAF technical bulletin TAB-R-164, when replacing a slope, underlayment must extend 4–6 inches into adjoining slopes. Reuse is prohibited. Underlayment replacement is required .

Q38: Adjuster says:

“We’ll only replace one plane of siding.”

Short Answer (with source):

Code requires WRB overlap across corners; partial wall replacement isn’t feasible .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve limited siding replacement to one plane. Per Maryland Code R703, WRB must overlap 6 inches at joints and corners, which requires removal of adjacent siding. Partial replacement is not feasible and violates code .

Q39: Carrier says:

“We won’t cover ventilation removal.”

Short Answer (with source):

GAF requires ridge ventilation be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes ventilation. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed when replacing adjoining slopes. They cannot be reused without risking water intrusion. Ventilation must be included .

Q40: Adjuster says:

“We don’t owe for drip edge.”

Short Answer (with source):

International Residential Code requires drip edge at eaves and rakes for asphalt shingles .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded drip edge. Per the Virginia adopted IRC, drip edge is required at eaves and rakes on asphalt shingle installations. This is a code-mandated component and must be included .

Q41: Carrier says:

“We’ll cover roof but not valley metal.”

Short Answer (with source):

VA Code requires valley flashing be replaced when deteriorated .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes valley flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, deteriorated flashing, including valleys, must be replaced when reroofing. Valley metal must be included in scope .

Q42: Adjuster says:

“We’ll cover slope but not hip shingles.”

Short Answer (with source):

Hip shingles must be removed for slope replacement and cannot be reinstalled .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved slope replacement but excluded hips. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, hip shingles must be removed when adjoining slopes are replaced. They cannot be reused; new hip shingles are required .

Q43: Carrier says:

“Only slope replacement, no ice/water shield.”

Short Answer (with source):

Ice/water shield required at eaves in snow-prone areas per IRC .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied ice/water shield. Per the IRC as adopted in Virginia, ice barrier underlayment is required at eaves in regions subject to ice dams. This must be included for code compliance .

Q44: Adjuster says:

“We won’t cover ridge vent replacement.”

Short Answer (with source):

Ridge vents must be removed for adjoining slope work and cannot be reused .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes ridge vent replacement. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge vents must be removed during adjoining slope replacement. Reuse compromises performance and violates manufacturer instructions. Ridge vent replacement must be included .

Q45: Carrier says:

“We don’t owe for starter shingles.”

Short Answer (with source):

Manufacturer guidelines require starter strips on eaves and rakes for wind warranty .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded starter shingles. Per GAF installation standards, starter strips are required along eaves and rakes to maintain wind resistance warranty coverage. Starter shingles are a mandatory component .

Q46: Adjuster says:

“We won’t cover ridge caps because they look fine.”

Short Answer (with source):

Ridge caps must be removed when slopes are replaced; reinstallation voids coverage .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded ridge caps. Per GAF Slope Replacement Requirements, ridge caps must be removed to install new underlayment and shingles. Once removed, they cannot be reused without voiding warranty. New ridge caps must be included .

Q47: Carrier says:

“We don’t cover step flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

VA Code requires replacement of damaged flashing during reroofing .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial excludes step flashing. Per VA Code 908.5, existing flashings that are rusted, damaged, or deteriorated must be replaced when reroofing. Step flashing is integral and cannot be reused .

Q48: Adjuster says:

“Only covering roof plane, not chimney flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

Code requires flashing at all penetrations; chimney flashing must be replaced .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded chimney flashing. Per IRC R703.4 as adopted in Maryland, flashing must be installed at all penetrations to prevent water entry. Chimney flashing replacement is required for compliance .

Q49: Carrier says:

“We’ll cover roof but not fascia metal.”

Short Answer (with source):

Collateral fascia dents documented in photo report prove storm damage .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve excluded fascia metal. Our attached photo report shows dents and creasing consistent with storm impact. Collateral damage must be included for proper restoration .

Q50: Adjuster says:

“We won’t cover skylight flashing.”

Short Answer (with source):

Flashing at penetrations must be replaced per code; skylights cannot be reused with old flashing .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve denied skylight flashing. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be installed at penetrations to prevent water intrusion. Skylight flashing cannot be reused once disturbed and must be replaced to maintain watertightness .

Q51: Adjuster says:

“We can repair by lifting shingles.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our repair attempt video shows shingles cracked during lifting — proving brittleness .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested repairs by lifting shingles. We attempted this, and the repair attempt video shows shingles cracking and breaking when lifted. This confirms brittleness and irreparability. Replacement is the only feasible option to restore the property .

Q52: Carrier says:

“Try a patch first.”

Short Answer (with source):

Patch test failed — new shingles don’t align with existing sealant strips .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial requests a patch attempt. We attempted repair, and the shingles fractured upon manipulation. Further, per the iTel report, the existing shingles are discontinued and English dimension, while replacements are metric. This creates misaligned sealant strips and voids manufacturer warranty. Repairs are not possible .

Q53: Adjuster says:

“You didn’t prove repair wasn’t possible.”

Short Answer (with source):

Repair attempt caused more damage — documented in video .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You stated we did not prove repairs impossible. Our repair attempt video shows that when shingles were lifted, they tore and fractured. This damage is conclusive evidence of irreparability. Replacement is required .

Q54: Carrier says:

“Repairs will be minor.”

Short Answer (with source):

Even minor repairs cracked shingles, confirming brittleness .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial suggests only minor repairs are needed. We attempted such repairs, and even slight lifting of shingles caused cracking. This proves brittleness and irreparability. Minor repairs are not an option .

Q55: Adjuster says:

“We’ll repair siding with a panel swap.”

Short Answer (with source):

Removing siding panels damages adjoining ones, requiring full wall replacement .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You proposed repairing siding by swapping panels. Per our siding argument documentation, removing individual panels requires detaching corner posts and adjoining panels, causing consequential damage. This makes partial repair infeasible. Full replacement is required .

Q56: Carrier says:

“Corner post removal is simple.”

Short Answer (with source):

Removing corner posts causes consequential siding damage per siding repair standards .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested corner post removal is minor. In reality, per our siding argument, removing corner posts necessitates detaching full wall sections of siding. This process causes consequential damage and makes simple repairs impossible .

Q57: Adjuster says:

“We can reuse siding panels.”

Short Answer (with source):

Siding panels distort and crack when removed, making reuse impossible .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated siding panels can be reused. However, per our siding argument documentation, panels crack and distort when removed due to interlocking mechanisms. Reuse compromises fit and watertightness. Replacement is required .

Q58: Carrier says:

“Repair attempt wasn’t needed.”

Short Answer (with source):

Repair attempts are industry standard to confirm irreparability .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed the repair attempt as unnecessary. Repair tests are industry standard to confirm whether patching is possible. Our attempt caused additional shingle damage, proving irreparability. Replacement is justified .

Q59: Adjuster says:

“We’ll approve repair of flashing only.”

Short Answer (with source):

Step and counter flashing cannot be removed without damaging siding/roof .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved flashing repair only. Per VA code and flashing installation requirements, step and counter flashing are integrated into siding and roof coverings. They cannot be removed or repaired without causing consequential damage. Full replacement is necessary .

Q60: Carrier says:

“We’ll approve spot shingle replacement.”

Short Answer (with source):

Spot repairs cracked shingles and failed brittle test .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

Your denial suggests spot shingle replacement. Our repair attempt shows that individual shingle replacement caused additional cracking. Spot repair failed brittle testing and is not feasible. Full slope replacement is required .

Q61: Adjuster says:

“Metal roof can be spot repaired.”

Short Answer (with source):

Metal panels interlock; removal damages adjoining panels .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated metal roofing can be spot repaired. Per our photo documentation, metal panels interlock, and removal requires detaching adjoining panels, causing distortion. Spot repair is not feasible; replacement is necessary .

Q62: Carrier says:

“Flat roof can be patched.”

Short Answer (with source):

Patching violates manufacturer warranty; full system integrity is required .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested patching the flat roof. Per state code and manufacturer requirements, patching voids warranty and does not restore system integrity. Full section replacement is required to comply with building code .

Q63: Adjuster says:

“Aluminum siding can be spot replaced.”

Short Answer (with source):

Aluminum siding dents cannot be corrected; matching profiles are discontinued .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested spot replacement for aluminum siding. Aluminum dents cannot be repaired, and per our siding argument, profiles are discontinued and mismatches inevitable. Full replacement is required .

Q64: Carrier says:

“Vinyl siding repair is simple.”

Short Answer (with source):

Vinyl becomes brittle with age; removal cracks panels .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve described vinyl siding repair as simple. In reality, aged vinyl becomes brittle and cracks during removal. This is documented in our siding argument evidence. Repair is not feasible without causing more damage .

Q65: Adjuster says:

“Shingle repairs are safe.”

Short Answer (with source):

Our repair test shows cracking and sealant failure during attempts .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated repairs are safe. Our repair attempt shows cracking, sealant separation, and additional damage during attempted repairs. This is proof repairs are not safe or viable. Full replacement is required .

Q66: Carrier says:

“We can repair skylight flashing only.”

Short Answer (with source):

Skylight flashing cannot be reused once removed; requires replacement .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve approved flashing repair only. Per IRC R703.4, flashing must be watertight at penetrations. Skylight flashing cannot be reused once disturbed and must be replaced to maintain integrity .

Q67: Adjuster says:

“We’ll replace individual tabs only.”

Short Answer (with source):

Tabs cracked during repair attempt, confirming irreparability .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested replacing individual shingle tabs. Our repair attempt showed that lifting tabs caused cracking and separation. This confirms irreparability. Replacement is required .

Q68: Carrier says:

“Your brittle test isn’t valid.”

Short Answer (with source):

Brittle testing is industry standard and widely accepted .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve dismissed our brittle test. Repair attempt testing is an accepted industry standard to determine shingle reparability. The documented cracking during our test confirms irreparability and requires replacement .

Q69: Adjuster says:

“Sealant re-bonding solves repair issues.”

Short Answer (with source):

Sealant strips failed to re-bond in repair attempt; warranty voided .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated sealant re-bonding solves issues. Our repair attempt shows sealant strips did not re-bond after lifting, leaving the shingles vulnerable to wind uplift. Manufacturer warranties are void in this condition. Replacement is required .

Q70: Carrier says:

“We’ll use alternate manufacturer shingles.”

Short Answer (with source):

Mixing manufacturers violates warranty and creates mismatches .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve suggested alternate manufacturer shingles. The iTel report confirms no acceptable match exists. Mixing shingles from different manufacturers violates warranty and causes visual and structural mismatches. Replacement is required .

Q71: Adjuster says:

“Your test caused the damage.”

Short Answer (with source):

Repair attempt cracking is proof of brittleness, not damage creation .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve stated our repair test caused the damage. In fact, the cracking during the repair attempt is conclusive evidence of brittleness and irreparability. Industry standards support testing as proof of storm-related failure .

Q72: Carrier says:

“Aluminum wrap can be reused.”

Short Answer (with source):

Aluminum wrap is distorted once removed and cannot be reused .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):

To whom it may concern,

You’ve proposed reusing aluminum wrap. Per our siding argument documentation, aluminum wrap distorts when removed and cannot be reused. Replacement is the only feasible option .

Q73: Adjuster says:

“You didn’t provide enough repair attempts.”

Short Answer (with source):

One failed repair attempt is sufficient to prove irreparability .

Detailed Answer (Email Draft):
