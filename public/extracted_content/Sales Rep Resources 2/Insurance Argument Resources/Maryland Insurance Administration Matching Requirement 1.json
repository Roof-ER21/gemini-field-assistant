The Bulletin noted that replacement of \ndamaged siding with new siding may result in a mismatch between existing siding and newly \ninstalled siding due to color shade, texture or dimension. Bulletin No. 97-1 advised that if a \nmismatch occurs, settlement options include moving undamaged siding from other less visible \nareas of the house to replace damaged siding, replacement of both damaged and undamaged \nsiding on one or more sides of a house, replacement of all siding, and/or a monetary allowance to \nreflect diminution in value of the house caused by mismatch. Bulletin No. 97-1 also noted that \nthe law does not require a replacement cost policy to ensure in every instance the replacement of \nall siding, including undamaged siding, in order to eliminate or minimize mismatching. At the \nsame time, the MIA advised that insurers whose settlement practices failed to take into account \nmajor differences in color shades, textures, or siding dimensions would be subject to \nadministrative action under Section 230A, Article 48A of the Code, which has been recodified as \npresent Title 27, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article. \n \nAt the time MIA Bulletin No. 97-1 was issued, policy language typically provided \ncoverage for direct physical damage not otherwise excluded in the policy. Since the issuance of \nBulletin 97-1 in 1997, however, most insurance policies now contain policy language \nspecifically excluding mismatch claims. Terms, conditions and exclusions with respect to \nmismatch vary among insurers and policies. Moreover, the specific language of the individual \ninsurance policy governs the rights, duties and obligations of the insurer and the policyholder.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAL REDMER, JR. \nCommissioner \n \nNANCY GRODIN \nDeputy Commissioner \n \n \nLARRY HOGAN \nGovernor \n \nBOYD K.

    "content": "In the absence of specific policy exclusion for mismatch claims, the advice contained in \nBulletin 97-1 still applies. Mismatch exclusions may apply to aluminum siding claims as well as \nother exterior finish materials such as roofing. \n \nWhile most policies now contain a specific exclusion for mismatch claims, some insurers \nalso offer optional coverage for mismatch claims. This coverage is not generally automatically \nincluded within a homeowners policy, but may be purchased at an additional cost. The terms, \nconditions and cost of such optional mismatch coverage vary among insurers and policies. To \nfind out whether your insurer offers additional coverage for mismatch claims, Maryland \nconsumers are encouraged to contact their producer or insurer for further information. \n \nFor questions regarding this Bulletin or for further information, please contact the \nMaryland Insurance Administration at 410-468-2000 or 800-492-6116. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAl Redmer, Jr. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommissioner \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy:\n_____ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJoy Hatchette \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssociate Commissioner \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsumer Education and Advocacy \n \n \n \nsignature on original"
