The strip should\noverlap the new underlayment on the replacement plane and be inserted\nbetween the shingles and existing underlayment on the adjacent roof\nplane. The overlap should extend at least 4” (102 mm) to 6” (152 mm) on\nboth planes.\n○\nOption 2: The new underlayment should extend at least 4” (102 mm) to 6”\n(152 mm) over the hips and inserted between the shingles and existing\nunderlayment on the adjacent roof plane.\n○\nAny nails that were removed from existing shingles must be replaced (nails\nshould be relocated). Existing nail holes and any shingles where the sealant\nbond has been broken must be resealed by hand to ensure a weather-tight\nroofing system. For more information on hand sealing, refer to TAB-R-114\nHand Sealing Shingles.\n●\nAt ridge locations:\n○\nFor the shingles on the adjacent roof plane that will remain in place, nails\nmay need to be removed for the new underlayment to be inserted between\nthe shingles and existing underlayment.\n○\nThe new underlayment should extend at least 4” (102 mm) to 6” (152 mm) to\nfold over the ridge and be inserted between the shingles and existing\nunderlayment.\n○\nIf the nails in the top course of shingles interfere with inserting the new\nunderlayment at least 4” (102 mm) to 6” (152 mm), those shingles may need\nto be removed. Once a shingle has been fully removed, it should not be\nreinstalled.\nR3 10282024"
