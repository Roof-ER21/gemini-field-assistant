Underlayment Requirements For Hips And Ridges When
Replacing a Single Roof Plane
What Are The
Underlayment
Requirements For
Hips And Ridges?
When replacing a single roof plane, follow the instructions below:
●
Remove field shingles and underlayment from the roof plane.
●
Carefully remove hip/ridge cap shingles along with any hip/ridge ventilation
products, if applicable.
●
Slice/cut underlayment along the hip/ridge to provide a clean edge.
●
At hip locations:
○
For the shingles on the adjacent roof plane that will remain in place, remove
nails at the ends of the shingles so that the new underlayment may be
inserted between the shingles and existing underlayment.
○
Option 1: Use a strip of underlayment to run down the hip. The strip should
overlap the new underlayment on the replacement plane and be inserted
between the shingles and existing underlayment on the adjacent roof
plane. The overlap should extend at least 4” (102 mm) to 6” (152 mm) on
both planes.
○
Option 2: The new underlayment should extend at least 4” (102 mm) to 6”
(152 mm) over the hips and inserted between the shingles and existing
underlayment on the adjacent roof plane.
○
Any nails that were removed from existing shingles must be replaced (nails
should be relocated). Existing nail holes and any shingles where the sealant
bond has been broken must be resealed by hand to ensure a weather-tight
roofing system. For more information on hand sealing, refer to TAB-R-114
Hand Sealing Shingles.
●
At ridge locations:
○
For the shingles on the adjacent roof plane that will remain in place, nails
may need to be removed for the new underlayment to be inserted between
the shingles and existing underlayment.
○
The new underlayment should extend at least 4” (102 mm) to 6” (152 mm) to
fold over the ridge and be inserted between the shingles and existing
underlayment.
○
If the nails in the top course of shingles interfere with inserting the new
underlayment at least 4” (102 mm) to 6” (152 mm), those shingles may need
to be removed. Once a shingle has been fully removed, it should not be
reinstalled.

●
If the hip or ridge includes ventilation, the new underlayment must be trimmed to
the edge of the vent slots.
●
Once complete, install the new hip/ridge cap shingles in accordance with the
appropriate installation instructions.
