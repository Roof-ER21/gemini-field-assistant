What Are Some Causes For 
“Storm Damage” To 
Shingles? 
Damage to shingles caused by extraordinary weather conditions such as hurricanes, hail, tornadoes, lightning, 
winds higher than warranted, or cold-weather related damages such as ice-damming.                                
Does The GAF Shingle 
Limited Warranty Cover 
This Type Of Damage? 
Extraordinary weather related damages as described above are specifically excluded from coverage*.  This 
damage may be immediately noticeable, or can be latent damage in which case evidence of any damage may 
not be immediately apparent.  This latent damage caused by severe weather or flying debris may cause the 
shingles to deteriorate prematurely. 
 
*Some GAF shingles are warranted to withstand winds up to 130 mph following when using GAF 
WeatherBlocker™ or Pro-Start™ starter strips and 6 (or more) nails. 
What Are Some Examples 
Of Latent Damage That I 
Could Expect To See? 
Latent damage may take on many forms such as: 
 
Granule loss at points of impact of debris or caused by stresses the shingles endure 
 
Cracks in the granule-asphalt surfacing – especially if high winds blew the shingles back 
 
Exposed fiberglass mat – which may or may not be immediately visible 
 
Loosening of the self-seal integrity creating the potential for future shingle blow-off 
What If I have Granule Loss 
Concerns? 
Loss of mineral granules as an immediate or gradual consequence of storm damage exposes the asphalt 
coating directly to the environment.  This granule loss may result in the accelerated aging and the premature 
deterioration of the shingles.   
 
Any shingle failures caused by storm damage, immediate or as a result of latent damage, is beyond the scope 
of the GAF Shingle Limited Warranty, and is not be the responsibility of GAF.   
 
Note: Granule loss is NOT just cosmetic damage and “sugaring,” the process of adding loose granules to 
damaged shingle with asphalt cement, is not a permanent repair. 
Is There Anything Else To 
Be Aware Of? 
“Blue Tarped Roofs”:  As immediately effective as tarping a damaged roof is to protect the building, securing 
the tarp by nailing through the shingles damages the shingles.  Shingles that were nailed through must be 
replaced; caulking these nail holes is not a permanent repair and creates a maintenance item that is not a 
“material defect” covered by a manufacturer’s warranty. 
Can Several Individual 
Shingles Be Replaced Or 
Should The Entire Roof Be 
Replaced? 
While individual damaged shingles on a roof can be replaced, it generally is not recommended if there are 
more than 2 or 3 damaged shingles on a roof or a plane (section) of the roof because the process of replacing 
individual shingles requires breaking the self-seal of the surrounding shingles, removing their nails, and 
bending them to remove the damaged shingles and then re-fastening them … all of which can damage the 
shingles if not done properly.  In addition, the color of new shingles inserted will not match the color of the 
shingles that have weathered for even a few years.   
 
For long term performance as well as aesthetic reasons, complete replacement is recommended for roofs 
that have a significant number of shingles that need to be replaced due to storm damage.  An additional 
benefit to complete replacement is the ability of the roofing professional to check for latent damage – 
something that is difficult to do if just a few shingles are replaced. If the damage is confined to one plane of 
the roof, replacement of the just the damaged roof plane may be possible.
