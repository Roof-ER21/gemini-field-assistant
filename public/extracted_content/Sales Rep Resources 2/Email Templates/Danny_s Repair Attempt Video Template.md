To whom it may concern,

Please see the attached video link and photo report of the attempted repair for the claim number [#_____]. As can be clearly seen in the video and pictures, the homeowner's roof sustained additional damage during the attempted repairs. This confirms a failed brittle test for the shingles, indicating irreparability.

With this fact established, your estimate as it currently stands would not actually fix the damages, but would in fact further compromise the integrity of the roof as a whole. Therefore I have gone ahead and attached an estimate below that accurately reflects the full scope of work necessary to make our mutual client whole again.

I also ask that you take note of the before and after pictures of the attempted repair. Due to the brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing. These photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably do further damage to surrounding shingles.

1. These can be seen in the updated photo report under the "Brittle Test" section, and best shown in Photos:(___)

2. Please find these photos attached below.

I kindly ask that you review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so we can begin to move forward with the necessary full [Roof AND/OR Siding] replacement to restore our mutual client's property to pre-storm condition.

If we can provide any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your time and for working with us to assist [HOMEOWNER’S NAME] in restoring their property effectively after the loss they have experienced.
