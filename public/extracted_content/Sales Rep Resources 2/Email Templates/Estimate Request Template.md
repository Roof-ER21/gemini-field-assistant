Hello!

This is [REP NAME]  with Roof-ER. We are assisting [CUSTOMER’S NAME] with the claim referenced above. Attached you will find a signed Claim Authorization and our Photo Report [IF YOU’VE ATTACHED IT, IF NOT PLEASE DELETE THAT LINE]

I am reaching out in regards to an estimate for the scope of repairs that should have been created after an inspection of [CUSTOMER NAME]’S property that happened on [DATE OF INSPECTION IF APPLICABLE].

If you are still working on the estimate, no problem at all! However, once you have a finalized estimate, please send a copy to both [CUSTOMER’S NAME] and to me as soon as possible.

We at Roof-ER want to quickly and effectively restore our mutual client’s property back to pre-storm condition as soon as possible. Please let me know if you need anything else from me.

Thank you for working with us to assist [CUSTOMER’S NAME] with this project.
