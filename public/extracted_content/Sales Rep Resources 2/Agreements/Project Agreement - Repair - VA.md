TERMS OF AGREEMENT 
 
1. Time: Contractor will use reasonable efforts but does not guarantee the date of Work start or completion. There will be an 
allowance of additional time if delays are caused by (1) Customer(s), (2) special orders for construction materials, (3) 
subcontractor or supplier, (4) alterations required to the Work, (5) unforeseen conditions at the site, (6) natural causes such 
fire, rain or storm, or (7) conditions beyond Contractor’s control. Contractor has the right to cancel this Agreement and 
without liability or obligation (except return of deposit with appropriate debits for Services provided) in case of non-payment, 
emergency, strike, or factors beyond the control of the Contractor. Delay or cancellation of a scheduled workday by the 
Customer(s) requires a minimum of 5 days prior notification or the Customer(s) shall be subject to paying a full crew day’s 
labor charge at Contractor’s prevailing labor rate. Contractor may increase the prices charged if Customer(s) delays 
acceptance, start or completion of the Work. 
 
2. Payment: Customer(s) shall pay Contractor the amounts due on the dates set out in this Agreement. When any payment 
is due under this Agreement, Contractor may charge the Customer(s) credit card and provide notice to Customer(s) 
after such charge has been processed. It is understood that the Contract Price does not include expenses for dealing with 
hidden or unknown contingencies found at the job site (which includes any cost related to asbestos or lead paint abatement, 
removal or encapsulation) ("Extra Work"). In the event the Contractor determines that Extra Work is necessary, the 
additional cost for the Extra Work will be paid by the Customer(s). Should Extra Work be identified, Contractor will notify 
the Customer(s), provide the cost for such Extra Work, and give the Customer(s) 24 hours’ notice before commencing such 
Extra Work. If Customer(s) does not protest the Extra Work within such 24 hours, then Customer(s) shall be responsible for 
payment of the cost. If the Customer(s) protests the Extra Work within the 24-hour period, then Contractor can refuse to 
perform the Extra Work in which case the Contractor is released from any claim for damages resulting from the non-
performance of the Extra Work (such as leaks or structural failures), and the Warranty described in Section 6 below will not 
be provided for any of the Services. Contractor may request payments in advance of the payment schedule if Customer(s) is 
late with any payment or if Customer(s) notifies Contractor of a dispute. +In the event there are punch list items or 
adjustments after substantial completion of the Services, Customer(s) may withhold a maximum of five percent (5%) of the 
total Price until such punch list items or adjustments are completed. Contractor at its sole discretion shall determine when the 
punch list items or adjustments are completed so that the five (5) percent withheld must be paid. Contractor may suspend 
Work if Customer(s) fails to make full payment on the due dates. *Any additional monies received from the insurance 
company as supplements, cost increases, and/or general contractor overhead and profit will be paid in addition to the contract 
price above. 
 
3. Insurance Support: If the Customer(s) wishes to recover the Contract Price from its property insurance carrier, it is the 
responsibility of the Customer(s) to submit a claim to the Customer(s)'s property insurance company. Customer(s) 
understands that the amount owed is not subject to collection of such amounts from the insurance carrier. If requested by the 
insurance company, Contractor agrees to be present at the insurance company’s inspection of the Job Site to provide 
additional information as requested by the insurance company to support the agreed Services and supplying additional reports 
as may be reasonably requested by the insurance company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer(s) acknowledges 
that Contractor is not a public adjuster and will not engage in public adjusting with the insurance company on 
Customer(s)’s behalf. 
 
4. Permits/Inspections: Customer(s) is responsible for defining the Project property boundaries, obtaining all required 
zoning variances and building permits. However, Contractor will coordinate all building inspections. When requested by 
Contractor, Customer(s) must sign required documents and make the Property available for inspection. 
 
5. Change Orders: Contractor may accept Change Orders initiated by the Customer(s) in which event an additional charge 
will apply to such Change Order as calculated by Contractor. If Contractor requests a written Change Order or Clarification, 
Customer(s) must execute the Change Order before Contractor is required to commence such additional Work. Change 
Orders may cause a delay in the completion date. 
 
6. Warranty: Company does not offer, nor represents to offer, any form of warranty for the Repair Specifications or Extra 
Work that may be required per this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, any labor, material, or workmanship, 
warranties. Customer acknowledges that Company has agreed to perform repair work in a good-faith manner and is not to be 
held liable for any issues that may arise, directly or indirectly, as a result of the repair work.

7. Disputes: Customer(s) must inform Contractor in writing of any problems with the Work and give Contractor a reasonable 
time to cure such problem. Failure to notify Contractor in writing of any problem within fifteen (15) days from the discovery 
of such problem by Customer(s), shall be considered a waiver of such problem and any warranty relating thereto. 
 
8. Default: If Customer(s) fails to make any payment on the date due or fails to make the Property available when requested 
by Contractor (and such failure continues for more than three (3) business days), Contractor may, at its sole discretion, 
terminate this Agreement, retain all sums paid by Customer(s), charge Customer(s) for all sums paid by Contractor for 
construction materials ordered, charge Customer(s) for all labor provided (including inspections and preparation of a quote), 
and charge a $1,000 cancellation fee. Alternatively, if Customer(s) fails to make any payment on the date due, Contractor at 
its sole discretion may suspend Work and withhold delivery of construction materials until payment is received. A late fee of 
five percent (5%) shall apply to any payment not paid when due. In addition, Customer(s) shall pay one and one-half percent 
(1.5%) interest per month on any late payment from the date due. Customer(s) shall pay to Contractor attorney’s fees of 25% 
of the amount of the claim, plus expert witness fees and costs incurred by Contractor to collect unpaid sums, enforce this 
Agreement and/or defend a claim involving this Agreement. 
 
9. Risk: Customer(s) understands that the Work may involve some risk of personal injury and property damage. Customer(s) 
must move all furniture, window screens, hangings and other personal property away from the Work area(s) at a sufficient 
distance and appropriate location so that the property will be protected, will not impact the Work and will not impede 
Contractor’s access to the Work area(s). Customer(s) shall follow instructions of Contractor with regard to preventing injury 
to property of person. Customer(s) will not hold Contractor liable for personal injury, damage to mechanical systems, or 
property damage, even if caused by a subcontractor, unless caused by the gross negligence of the Contractor. Customer(s) 
agrees to carry full coverage on the Property covering Customer(s)’s risk of injury or damage to which insurance Customer(s) 
will exclusively look for compensation in the event of loss or injury.
