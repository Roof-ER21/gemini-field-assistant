Failed Repair = Full Replacement:\nIf shingles crack/break during manipulation (brittle test), repairs are not possible.\nUse Repair Attempt Template.\n2. Discontinued Shingles:\nUse GAF's discontinued list or iTel to prove repairs cannot be blended.\nMixing old/new is not acceptable.\n3. Slope Rule (Virginia):\nAsphalt shingles only allowed on slopes 2/12 or greater.\nFlatter slopes must use flat roof system.\n4. Siding Replacement (Maryland):\nPer code, housewrap & barrier required.\nReplacement of siding is often unavoidable due to code + mismatch issues.\n5. Flashing:\nCode requires replacing damaged/rusted flashings.\nInsurance cannot demand reuse.\n6. Storm Damage = Replacement:\nGAF states latent hail/wind damage (granule loss, cracks, mat exposure)\nleads to roof failure.\nPatch repairs not reliable.\n7. Partial Approvals:\nGAF slope replacement guidelines show disturbing adjacent slopes\nrequires full replacement of adjoining sections.\n8. Insurance Weather Data:\nAlways ask which source they used.\nCounter with iTel or HailTrace reports.\n9. Mismatch (Maryland):\nBulletin 18-23 requires insurers to address shade/texture mismatch.\nElsewhere, argue loss of value + discontinued product.\n10. Escalation Path:\n(1) Template → (2) Code/Manufacturer Support → (3) Homeowner Complaint\n→ (4) Arbitration/Appraisal if needed.\nFor Roof-ER field reps – Use this sheet during claims and adjuster meetings."
