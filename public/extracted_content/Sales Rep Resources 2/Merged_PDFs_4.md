To whom it may concern,
Please see the attached video link and photo report of the attempted repair for the claim number
[#_____]. As can be clearly seen in the video and pictures, the homeowner's roof sustained
additional damage during the attempted repairs. This confirms a failed brittle test for the shingles,
indicating irreparability.
With this fact established, your estimate as it currently stands would not actually fix the damages,
but would in fact further compromise the integrity of the roof as a whole. Therefore I have gone
ahead and attached an estimate below that accurately reflects the full scope of work necessary to
make our mutual client whole again.

↓[USE THIS PARAGRAPH ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES]↓
I also ask that you take note of the before and after pictures of the attempted repair. Due to the
brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were
attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing. These photos clearly
demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably
do further damage to surrounding shingles.
1. These can be seen in the updated photo report under the "Brittle Test" section, and best shown
in Photos:(___)
OR
2. Please find these photos attached below.
I kindly ask that you review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so
we can begin to move forward with the necessary full [Roof AND/OR Siding] replacement to restore
our mutual client's property to pre-storm condition.
If we can provide any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Thank you for your time and for working with us to assist [HOMEOWNER’S NAME] in restoring their
property effectively after the loss they have experienced.

This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER. I am assisting [CUSTOMER’s NAME]. Attached is our Photo
Report, Claim Authorization, and GAF Storm Damage Guidelines.
GAF's guideline to not repair any more than 2 or 3 shingles. A repair at the level that is in your
current decision would cause significantly more damage to [CUSTOMER NAMES]’s roof, and
would not be an effective solution to restore his property after the hail storm that impacted his
house.
Please update your current estimate to take this into consideration.
We sincerely appreciate your time and assistance.

To whom it may concern
This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER. I am the contractor assisting [CUSTOMER’S NAME]. Attached
you will find an iTel report [AND any additional documents if you attach them.]
[Use the following APPLICABLE arguments]
Per the attached iTel report, there are no similar matches available which makes a patch repair
impossible
Per the attached iTel report, the existing shingle is discontinued. We have attempted to contact the
suppliers listed on the report to secure the suggested samples, however each supplier noted [they
do not carry the suggested product/the suggested product would need to be special-ordered by the
pallet, meaning the costs to do so would be more exorbitant than simply replacing the roof]. As a
result, the approved scope of work cannot be completed as currently written.
(Homeowner's) shingles are the English-dimension architectural shingles which are no longer in
production. The new metric-dimension shingles have a larger exposure size and for that reason,
cannot be mixed with the existing shingles via a repair. If we try to repair with the new shingles, the
sealant on the shingle above would not secure to the correct portion of the new underlying shingle.
The sealant would be secured to the granules on the underlying shingle - any reputable contractor
knows a proper repair cannot be completed in this fashion.
Please review these findings and revise your estimate accordingly so we can begin to move forward
with the full replacement for [HOMEOWNER’S NAME]. If we can provide additional information,
please let us know. Thank you for your time and for working with us to assist [HOMEOWNER’S
NAME] in restoring their property effectively after the loss they have experienced.

To Whom it May Concern
This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER. I am the contractor assisting [CUSTOMER’S NAME]. Attached
you will find [MAKE SURE TO EDIT THIS SECTION FOR WHAT DOCUMENTS YOU ARE
ACTUALLY ATTACHING] my photo report [AND/OR], an iTel Report, [AND/OR] a repair estimate
that includes the siding.
[INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO YOUR EMAIL]
Damage
You will find our photo report in the list of attachments citing additional damage not accounted for in
(insurance)'s original estimate. This damage is consistent with what has already been approved
which leaves us and the homeowner unsure why these findings were left off of the estimate.
[Additional details as needed]
Discontinued
This estimate is for a full siding replacement due to the existing siding being discontinued. Per the
attached iTel report, there are no similar matches available and so our estimate accounts for all
elevations of siding.
The current siding is discontinued. The similar siding that is available would have to be special
ordered and paint matched. Because of those things, it would not be a cost-effective solution to
restore [HOMEOWNER’s] siding. The only way to effectively make them whole again would be with
full siding replacement.
Code/Housewrap
Per building code, we are required to install a house wrap on exterior wall sheathing to prevent
moisture from getting to the building envelope. Further, we are required to follow the manufacturer's
installation instructions while applying the weather barrier. These instructions state we must overlap
Housewrap 6" over any outside corners. This would require us to remove the existing aluminum
outside corner and detach the aluminum panels on the adjacent run that meet at that corner post.
This is not only impractical, but also impossible without causing further damage to metal siding
panels, as they will inevitably sustain damage during the removal process. Due to this
consequential damage, we have submitted our estimate for a full siding replacement
Please review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly so we can begin
to move forward with the full replacement for [HOMEOWNER’S NAME]. If we can provide additional
information, please let us know. Thank you for your time and for working with us to assist
[HOMEOWNER’S NAME] in restoring their property effectively after the loss they have
experienced.

To whom it may concern,
I, a loyal customer of [INSURANCE COMPANY], find your current decision for my home
unacceptable. I have chosen [INSURANCE COMPANY] to protect my home in the event that I find
myself in this situation. Your current decision will not effectively address the needs of my home after
the loss we have suffered from the storm.
My contractor, who is CC’d in this email, has provided documentation that outlines the most
effective way to make my property whole again [AND/OR] while your current decision would be an
ineffective solution for my roof [AND/OR] siding.
Please update your decision/estimate to reflect a full roof [AND/OR] siding approval. If necessary,
please have someone else come back to inspect the property.
Please let my contractor or myself know if you need anything else from us.
We look forward to hearing from you soon,
