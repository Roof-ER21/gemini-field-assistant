Insurance Process Steps & Timeline
*** Please note that every insurance company/ individual adjuster has slightly different timeline
based on multiple variables. Below is what we can typically expect:
Step 1: Schedule Adjuster Meeting
Assigned insurance adjuster will reach out within 1-3 business days to schedule their inspection of
your property
If you have interior or would like to make sure you are home for the inspection, please schedule and
let me know so I can fit it into my calendar
Otherwise, please have the adjuster call me directly to schedule
THE most important part to me helping you get fully approved… is that I am here for the insurance
company’s inspection.
Step 2: Adjuster Meeting
This meeting will typically be scheduled within 1-2 weeks of filing the claim varying based on the
adjuster’s current work load.
I will arrive 30 minutes prior to the scheduled adjuster meeting time to set up my ladder.
After the inspection, we will knock on your door to recap our inspection and to communicate the
next steps. If you are not home, I will call you to let you know how things went.
Step 3: Approved Scope of Work
Within 5 business days, the insurance company will provide an itemized estimate of the approved
scope of work.
If we have not received anything within a week of the adjuster meeting, we will begin following up
with you and the insurance company directly
Once you have received their written documentation please email that directly to myself and
