†Lifetime refers to the length of warranty coverage provided and means as long as the original individual owner(s) of a single-family detached residence [or eligible second owner(s)] owns the property where the qualifying GAF products are installed. For other owners/structures, Lifetime coverage is not applicable. Lifetime coverage on shingles requires the use of GAF Lifetime Shingles only. See the GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited Warranty for complete coverage and restrictions. Visit gaf.com/LRS for qualifying GAF products. Lifetime coverage on shingles and accessories requires the use of any GAF Lifetime Shingle and at least 3 qualifying GAF Accessories. See the GAF Roofing System Limited Warranty for complete coverage and restrictions. For installations not eligible for the GAF Roofing System Limited Warranty, see the GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited Warranty. Visit gaf.com/LRS for qualifying GAF products.

* GAF roofing systems in which Royal Sovereign® or Marquis WeatherMax® Shingles are installed in the field of the roof are not eligible for Lifetime warranty term. For complete coverage and restrictions, see GAF Shingle & Accessory Limited Warranty.
