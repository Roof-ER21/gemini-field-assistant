# What is a Deductible_

What is a homeowners deductible? 
 
- A homeowners insurance deductible is the amount a homeowner 
must pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage applies. 
When a claim is approved, the insurance company will cover the 
total damage cost minus the deductible amount. 
 
- The terminology can be confusing, it may be helpful to think of it as 
a copay, like when you go to the doctor. 
 
- It is important to note that if a deductible is not paid, there can be 
legal consequences and any deprecation and/or PWI will be 
forfeited. 
 
To whom is the deductible paid to? 
 
- You don’t pay your deductible directly to the insurance company 
like a bill. Instead, it’s deducted from your claim payout. You'll 
cover the remaining amount—your deductible—when paying the 
contractor or company repairing the damage. 
 
Per-Claim Basis: 
 
- It is important to note that homeowners insurance deductibles 
diFer from health insurance deductibles in that they are paid on a 
per-claim basis (per event), whereas a health insurance deductible 
has a maximum annual out of pocket.

Let’s Run Two Examples: 
 
- In the ﬁrst example, let’s say your deductible is $2,000 and you ﬁle 
a claim for storm damage to your roof. The insurance company 
then approves the work for $20,000. The insurance writes the 
estimate, subtracts the deductible, and pays out $18,000 while the 
remaining $2,000 (your deductible) is paid to the contractor. 
 
- Now let’s suppose your deductible is $1,000, and you ﬁle a claim 
for storm damage to your gutters. The insurance company 
approves the claim and estimates the repair cost at $900. Since the 
repair cost is less than your deductible, you’ll be responsible for 
covering the full amount.
