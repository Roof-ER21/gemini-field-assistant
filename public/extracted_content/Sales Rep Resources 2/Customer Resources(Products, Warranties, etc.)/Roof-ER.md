Re: GAF Silver Pledge™Limited Warranty Pilot
Dear Oliver Brown,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected to participate in a pilot program (“Pilot”)
during which you may offer your customers a GAF Silver Pledge™Limited Warranty (“Silver Pledge”) as
described in this letter. Your participation in this Pilot is based on your membership as a Certified
Contractor in the GAF Certified Roofing Contractor Program pursuant to the Program Participation
Agreement, dated September 15, 2023, between GAF and you (“Agreement”).
Subject to the terms and conditions of this letter and the Agreement, during the period from the date of
this letter until October 31, 2023 (the “Pilot Period”), GAF authorizes you to offer your customers, in only
your Designated Territory (as defined in the Agreement), a Silver Pledge in connection with your sale
and installation of GAF roofing products. For a Silver Pledge to qualify for inclusion in this Pilot, the roofing
products which are the subject of the Silver Pledge must be installed by October 31, 2023. All of the terms
and conditions of the Agreement apply to each Silver Pledge that is the subject of the Pilot. As such,
before participating in this Pilot and offering any Silver Pledges, you should closely review the terms and
conditions of the Agreement, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the “Commitments of
Contractor” section of the Agreement. You understand and agree that references to “Enhanced
Warranty” and “Enhanced Warranties” in the Agreement shall be deemed to include references to each
Silver Pledge you offer during the Pilot.
GAF reserves the right to terminate the Pilot or your participation in the Pilot and/or change the terms of
the Pilot at any time for any or no reason. Upon the termination of the Pilot entirely or your participation
in the Pilot or the expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason, all rights granted to you
under this letter shall immediately terminate, and you must cease offering your customers a Silver
Pledge.
We look forward to your participation in this Pilot.
Sincerely,
Bobby Fischer
VP, Partner Programs
