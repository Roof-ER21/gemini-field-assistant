       † Definition of Lifetime: The word “Lifetime” means as long as you, the original owner(s) [or the second owner(s) if coverage was properly transferred within the first 20 years], own the property where the shingles and/or accessories are installed. 
The Lifetime warranty term and 50-year non-prorated period are applicable only to shingles and accessories installed on a single-family detached residence owned by individuals. For any other type of owner or building, such as a corporation, 
governmental entity, religious entity, condominium or homeowner association, school, apartment building, office building, or multi-use structure, the length of the warranty is 40 years and the non-prorated period is 25 years.  
See Golden Pledge® Limited Warranty for Commercial and Multi-Family Properties for complete coverage and restrictions.
        *15-year Smart Choice® Protection Period for the StainGuard Plus PRO™ or StainGuard Plus™ Algae Protection Limited Warranty applies only if you install both StainGuard Plus PRO™-or StainGuard Plus™-labeled shingles and ridge cap 
shingles. For all other installations, the Smart Choice® Protection Period is 10-years.
      **Smart Choice® Protection Period: refers to the crucial period of time following installation of the GAF Products during which the coverage provided for in this limited warranty is non-prorated. After the Smart Choice® Protection Period specified 
above, the remedy provided for in this warranty may be different than that provided for during the Smart Choice® Protection Period, and any remedy will be reduced to reflect the use you have received from your GAF Products. The amount of use 
will be calculated by dividing the number of months which have elapsed since installation to the date of claim by the number of months in the warranty term. For a Lifetime† warranty, GAF’s contribution in years 51 and beyond is 20%. After the 
non-prorated period, GAF’s maximum liability for any roof shall NOT exceed three times the reasonable cost of replacement GAF Products before any reduction for use.
    ***Special Installation: Your GAF LayerLock®-labeled shingles will be covered up to the maximum wind speed above ONLY if installed using 4 nails per shingle and you have GAF Starter Strip Products installed at the eaves and rakes. Special 
Installation for all other GAF Shingles requires use of 6 nails per shingle and GAF Starter Strip Products installed at the eaves and rakes. Your GAF Ridge Cap Shingles will be covered up to the maximum wind speed above ONLY if your ridge cap 
shingles are installed in strict accordance with the “Maximum Wind Speed Coverage Under Limited Warranty” section of the applicable ridge cap shingle application instructions.
  ****WindProven™ Limited Wind Warranty requires installation of LayerLock®-labeled shingles using 4 nails per shingle, and at least four (4) qualifying accessories.
*****Misapplication Coverage: Misapplication Coverage Terms listed above pertain to GAF Shingles and Accessories installed on single-family detached residences owned by individual(s). For other types of owners or buildings, coverage lasts  
  for 25 years. See Golden Pledge® Limited Warranty for Commercial and Multi-Family Properties for complete coverage and restrictions.

Who Is Covered by This Limited Warranty; Transferability 
You are covered by this limited warranty if you live in the United States or Canada and are 
the original property owner (i.e., not a builder or installer) or the first subsequent owner if 
this warranty was properly transferred. 
This limited warranty may be transferred only once. The second owner must notify GAF in 
writing within one year after the property transfer for warranty coverage to be transferred. 
(Other than this one transfer, this warranty may not be transferred or assigned, directly 
or indirectly.) If the transfer takes place within the first 20 years after installation, the 
second owner is entitled to the same coverage as the original owner. If the transfer takes 
place afterwards, the length of this warranty shall be reduced to the two-year period after 
ownership changes. During this two-year period, GAF’s reimbursement to the second 
owner will be based only on the reasonable cost of replacement GAF Products, reduced by 
the amount of use that has been received from the GAF Products from date of installation 
through the date of claim.
Manufacturing Defects: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy 
GAF Warranty Company, LLC, a subsidiary of GAF, warrants that your GAF Products will remain 
free from manufacturing defects that adversely affect their performance during the applicable 
warranty term listed above. Note: Wind Warranty and Algae Warranty are covered separately  
below. For coverage related to Master Flow® Powered Attic Exhaust Ventilation Products,  
refer to your Master Flow® Powered Attic Exhaust Ventilation Products Limited Warranty 
Addendum (if applicable).
(1) During the Smart Choice® Protection Period: GAF will pay you the full reasonable 
cost of labor to repair or re-cover any defective GAF Product(s) (excluding non-GAF 
accessories, metal work, or flashings other than Covered Flashings), and will provide 
replacement GAF Products or the reasonable cost of obtaining replacement GAF Products, 
at GAF’s option. The costs of labor to tear off some or all of your GAF Products and disposal 
are included if necessary to repair your roof.
(2) After the Smart Choice® Protection Period: The repair or re-cover cost, replacement 
GAF Products, or reimbursement provided to you will be reduced to reflect the use you 
have received from your GAF Products. The amount of use will be calculated by dividing the 
number of months which have elapsed since installation to the date of claim by the number 
of months in the warranty term. For a Lifetime† warranty, GAF’s contribution in years 51 and 
beyond will be 20%. After the non-prorated period, GAF’s maximum liability for any roof 
shall NOT exceed three times the reasonable cost of replacement GAF Products before any 
reduction for use.
WindProven™ Limited Wind Warranty: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy 
This limited warranty is specifically conditioned on your meeting all eligibility 
requirements, including installation of LayerLock®-labeled shingles, GAF Ridge Cap 
Shingles, GAF Starter Strip Shingles, and a GAF Roof Deck Protection Product, plus your 
choice of either a GAF Leak Barrier Product or GAF Attic Ventilation Product, and your 
LayerLock®-labeled shingles being fastened and installed strictly in accordance with  
GAF’s application instructions. For installations which do not meet these eligibility 
requirements, see Wind Warranty section below. The limited warranty applies only to 
your LayerLock®-labeled shingles and does not apply to any GAF Accessory Products. 
GAF warrants to you that your LayerLock®-labeled shingles will not fail to seal, blow off, 
or sustain damage from winds (including gusts) after they should have sealed but did not 
due to a manufacturing defect. If your LayerLock®-labeled shingles do fail to seal, blow 
off, or suffer wind damage, GAF will reimburse you for the reasonable costs of replacing 
the blown-off or damaged shingles and hand-sealing any unsealed shingles. Costs related 
to underlayment, metal work, and flashings are not included. GAF’s maximum liability 
under this paragraph is to reimburse you for the cost of hand-sealing all of the LayerLock®-
labeled shingles on your roof.
Wind Warranty: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy 
GAF warrants to you that your GAF shingles and ridge cap shingles will not fail to seal, blow 
off, or sustain damage from winds (including gusts) up to the applicable wind speed listed 
above after they should have sealed but did not due to a manufacturing defect or their 
misapplication. If your shingles or ridge cap shingles do fail to seal, blow off, or suffer wind 
damage, GAF will reimburse you for the reasonable costs of replacing the blown-off shingles 
or damaged shingles or ridge cap shingles and head-sealing any unsealed shingles or ridge 
cap shingles. Costs relating to metal work and flashings (other than Covered Flashings) are 
not included. GAF’s maximum liability under this paragraph is to reimburse you for the cost 
of hand-sealing all of the shingles and ridge cap shingles on your roof.
Algae Warranty: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy 
This limited warranty applies only to shingles, ridge cap shingles, and starter strip shingles 
sold in packages bearing the StainGuard Plus PRO™, StainGuard Plus™, or StainGuard® 
logos. GAF warrants to you that blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) will not 
cause a pronounced discoloration of your StainGuard Plus PRO™-,StainGuard Plus™- or 
StainGuard®-labeled shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles for the warranty 
term listed above. If your StainGuard Plus PRO™-, StainGuard Plus™-, or StainGuard®-
labeled shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles exhibit a pronounced 
discoloration caused by blue-green algae during the Smart Choice® Protection Period listed 
above, GAF’s contribution will be either the reasonable cost of commercially cleaning your 
shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles or, at GAF’s sole option, replacing 
discolored shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles. The maximum cost to GAF 
shall be lesser of the original cost of the affected shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter 
strip shingles or the cost to clean the affected shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip 
shingles. During the remainder of the limited warranty period, GAF’s contribution to you 
will be reduced to reflect the amount of use you have received from your shingles, ridge 
cap shingles, or starter strip shingles since they were installed. The amount of use will be 
calculated by dividing the number of months which have elapsed since installation to the 
date of claim by the number of months in the Algae Warranty term.
Note: Preventing pronounced algae-related discoloration of your shingles, ridge cap 
shingles, and starter strip shingles is achieved through formulations or through unique 
blends of granules.
Misapplication: What Is Covered/Sole and Exclusive Remedy 
If any of your GAF Products or Covered Flashings is found to have an application error that 
adversely affects performance, GAF will arrange to have your roof repaired or re-covered or, 
at its sole option, will provide you with replacement GAF product(s) and reimburse you for 
the full reasonable cost of labor and other materials to repair or re-cover your roof, including 
Covered Flashings. The costs of labor to tear off some or all of your GAF Products and 
Covered Flashings and disposal are included if necessary to repair your roof.
If your claim arises out of an application error in your GAF Products or Covered Flashings, 
which is discovered or discoverable within the first two years after installation, it is the 
obligation of your Master Elite® Roofing Contractor to make all necessary repairs. In the 
event that GAF determines your Master Elite® Roofing Contractor is unable or unwilling to 
perform these repairs, GAF will arrange to have your roof repaired if the issues were caused 
by application errors within the scope of GAF liability under this limited warranty.
NOTE: Failure to install adequate ventilation is NOT an application error of your GAF 
Products and is not covered under this Limited Warranty. Due to the design of certain 
buildings, the replacement of existing flashings may be difficult, costly, or impractical. 
Please be sure to review these items with your roofing contractor.
What Is Not Covered 
Even if your GAF Products were not properly installed according to GAF’s application 
instructions or to standard good roofing practices, this limited warranty remains in effect. 
However, GAF will NOT be liable for and this warranty does NOT apply to:
(1) Damage resulting from anything other than an inherent manufacturing defect in the GAF 
Products, their misapplication, or the misapplication of Covered Flashings, such as:
	
(a) settlement, movement, structural damage, or defects in the building, walls, 
foundation, or the roof base over which the shingles or accessories were applied.
	
(b) inadequate ventilation.
(2) Damage resulting from causes beyond normal wear and tear, such as:
	
(a) acts of nature, such as hail, fire, or winds (including gusts) over the applicable wind 
speed listed above except there is no maximum wind speed restriction for shingles 
covered by the WindProven™ Limited Wind Warranty.
	
(b) impact of traffic on the roof or foreign objects, including damage caused by objects 
blown onto the roof by wind.
      (c) improper storage or handling of the GAF Products.
(3) Ice damming, except for leaks in the area of your roof covered by a GAF Leak 
Barrier which are caused by a manufacturing defect in your GAF Leak Barrier, its 
misapplication, or the misapplication of Covered Flashings.
(4) Shading or variations in the color of your GAF Products, chipping, fading, or peeling 
paint on your Master Flow® Attic Exhaust Vent, or Master Flow™ Pivot™ Pipe Boot 
Flashing, or discoloration or contamination caused by fungus, mold, lichen, algae 
(except for blue-green algae if your shingles, ridge cap shingles, or starter strip shingles 
were labeled with the StainGuard Plus PRO™, StainGuard Plus™, or StainGuard® logos), 
or other contaminants, including that caused by organic materials on the roof.
(5) Damage caused by, or the cost to repair or replace, products not sold by GAF, including 
but not limited to metal work and counterflashing.
(6) Improperly designed or installed gutter or downspout systems.
(7) Damage to the interior or exterior of the building, including, but not limited to, mold growth.
(8) Damage to or caused by rooftop  air-conditioning units (and their flashing), pipe 
works, brace works, skylights, rooftop satellite dishes or other radio/TV devices, 
counterflashing, or flashings other than those specifically included above.
Other Limitations Concerning Coverage 
Decisions as to the extent of repair, re-cover, or cleaning required, and the reasonable cost 
of such work, will be made solely by GAF. GAF reserves the right to arrange directly for your 
GAF Products to be repaired, re-covered, or cleaned instead of reimbursing you for such 
work. The remedy under this warranty is available only for that portion of your GAF Products 
actually exhibiting manufacturing defects, application errors (including misapplication of 
Covered Flashings), or algae discoloration at the time your claim is settled. Any replacement 
GAF Products will be warranted only for the remainder of the original warranty period. 
GAF reserves the right to discontinue or modify its shingles or accessories, including the 
colors available, so any replacement GAF Products may not be an exact match for the GAF 
Products on your roof. Even if GAF does not modify a color, replacement GAF Products may 
not match your original GAF Products due to normal weathering, manufacturing variations, 
or other factors. In the event that GAF is unable to provide replacement products, GAF 
reserves the right to provide the cash value of those replacement products. 
Claims: What You Must Do 
You must notify GAF about any claim within 30 days after you notice a problem. You may 
report a claim online at gaf.com/contact, by calling GAF at 1-800-458-1860, sending an 
email to warrantyclaims@gaf.com, or by sending a notice in writing to: GAF, Warranty 
Claims Department, 1 Campus Drive, Parsippany, NJ 07054, USA. You will then be provided 
with complete details about submitting your claim. You may be required to send to GAF, at 
your expense, photographs and sample products for testing. Within a reasonable time after 
proper notification, GAF will evaluate your claim and resolve it in accordance with the terms 
of this limited warranty. If you repair or replace your GAF Products before you notify GAF 
about your claim or before GAF has completed its evaluation of your claim, your claim may 
be denied. If you need to repair or replace your GAF Products before your claim is resolved, 
you MUST provide GAF with reasonable notice. NOTE: Notice to your contractor, dealer, 
or homebuilder is NOT notice to GAF. You should retain this document for your records in 
the unlikely event that you need to file a claim.
Sole and Exclusive Warranty 
THIS LIMITED WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND REPLACES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, 
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
WHETHER BY STATUTE, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. This limited warranty is your 
exclusive warranty from GAF and represents the SOLE REMEDY available to any owner of 
GAF Products. GAF makes NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, GUARANTEES, OR 
WARRANTIES of any kind other than that stated herein. GAF WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY 
EVENT FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES 
OF ANY KIND, including DAMAGE TO THE INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR OF ANY BUILDING, whether 
any claim against it is based upon breach of this warranty, negligence, strict liability in tort, 
or for any other cause. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may 
also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions do not 
allow limitations on or the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so the above 
limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. New Jersey state residents are encouraged 
to review their rights under the agreement, as provided under the New Jersey Truth-In-
Consumer Contract Warranty and Notice Act (“TCCWNA”).
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall NOT 
apply either to the sale of the GAF Products or to this limited warranty.
Modification of Warranty 
This limited warranty may not be changed or modified except in writing, signed by an officer 
of GAF. No one (other than an officer of GAF) has the authority to assume any additional or 
other liability or responsibility for GAF in connection with your GAF Products and Covered 
Flashings except as described in this limited warranty.
Effectiveness 
This limited warranty will not take effect unless all eligibility requirements have been 
satisfied, this warranty is registered to you, and your roofing contractor has been paid in full.
