(Y/N)\nNotes on Adjuster/Inspector\nChristian Ballester\nUSAA/Progressive/Liberty\nAdjuster\nY\nY\nAlways looking to buy. Appreciates when the roof/siding/exterior is already marked up. Get Hover ESX file so he can write estimate easily\nBadou Hadidane\nUSAA\nAdjuster\nN\nN\nTerrible. Try to get HO to call to get this claim reassigned instead. Spends 10 minutes on the roof and gets off not looking to buy. Most of the time will deny it and you will need to get the reinspection. Will only buy if there's lots of signs. Wants Hover report, but it wont change his decision if you give it to him or not. Might be a waste of time and money giving him the Hover report. Do not supplement his approvals \nVicki Henry\nHomesite (Afics)\nAdjuster\nY\nY\nVery easy to work with. Will use a ladder assist but buys most of the time if the roof is marked up well and damage makes sense. Get Hover ESX for her\nMatt Schneider\nTravelers\nAdjuster\nN\nY\nNice guy and willing to buy. Will use a ladder assist but very reasonable\nJared Hutto\nUSAA\nAdjuster\nY\nY\nMarks hail and claims he's buying but desk adjusters can deny his reports.

Here in town from Texas.his dad owns a sports fishing business in Costa Rica. He was cool about me chalking everything up but because I had already sent it to the adjuster he had to do his own test squares.

Uses a drone during inspection. \nNathan Casada\nPatriot Claims\nInspector\nN\nY\nLikes to have markings prior to inspection. Takes his time, will photograph all markings.

He on some BS. He told me that because there was no spatter present and says that it lasts for 18 months after hail he couldn't put that it was hail from the storm we claimed. Although he appreciated chalking everything up. I ended up getting the approval for both roof and siding with a re inspection. This dude didn't look out\nDaniel \nUSAA (Portillo Inspections)\nIA\nY\nY\nThis guy was definitely the boy. Traveling adjuster from Texas. Spanish guy. Said all his inspections get approved. He found even additional damage then I found and I found a lot. Very easy going. Loves that it's chalked up in advance. Will need HOVER. You definitely want this guy \nTommy C\nSeekNow\nLadder assist\nN\nN\nBe on the lookout for Tommy C from Seeknow. Pretends to be your guy and says heâ€™s going to get the roof approved only for him to say no damage in his report. Been fighting a claim he was assigned too for months now. \nJERSON \nGlobal Risk Solutions \nIA / Ladder Assit\nY\nN\nWhen you get this guy only mark small dots next to the hail hits on shingles DO NOT PUT TEST SQUARE PRIOR.

He covered all\nMATT SCHNEIDER \nTravelers\nDesk  adjuster\nN\nN\nThis guy is super cool. Loves outdoors, Make sure you know where all of the damages so you can point it out to him. He usually wants to buy. He's local and lives in Leesburg. Elevations of the house once he saw that and roof. He was super grateful for chalking it all up before hand definitely neatly chalk everything if you know this guy is coming \nBrandon Black Chevy\nSeekNow\nInspector \nN\nY\nDrives a black Chevy truck. Brown hair to his shoulders brown mustache wears hat backwards. Pretty cool Guy takes his time. Although I had everything chalked up he still did some chalking of his self. Overall pretty cool dude we shot the shit for the most part\nTiara Boykin\nTravelers \nStaff Adjuster\nN\nY\nWorks a lot of claims in Loundoun County. Had a pretty tough Seek now guy but still bought it for hail. Have a lot more success with travelers adjusters in Loundoun as opposed to fairfax county. Would recommend marking roof up prior.\nBJ\nREBUILD\nInspector/LadderAssist\nN\nY\nDude was pretty cool actually small white dude facial hair. Was genuinely a nice guy and only took pics of the best looking stuff so he was trying to look out forsure\nChris O.\nRebuild \nInspector/LadderAssist\nN\nN\nCool white guy. If there's collateral it's easier for him to look for hail on the shingles that he will agree with. He did his own test squares and chalked hail in all. He definitely was looking out. This dude is the boy for rebuild forsure \nJesse\nRebuild\nInspector/LadderAssist\nN\nN\nThis guy is complete garbage. If there is a way to change this vendor to someone else. Do it. He's standoffish doesn't want to talk says he's not there to be your friend. Definitely switch this guy. My photo report got the roof bought not rebuilds. \nGreg\nRebuild \nInspector/LadderAssist\nN\nN\nVery standoffish doesn't want to talk. Army vet. Isn't there to help you he takes terrible photos simply hovers his phone over the damage and doesn't truly try to take a good photo. \nClayton Buttle\nUSAA\nIA\nY\nN\nSuper chill laid back guy from SC likes to talk about his kids. Very family oriented. He doesn't drink anything sugary so don't bring gatorade if you meet him. Will buy everything you show him so be sure to bring your light. Give him a little bit of room to do his own thing. He'll mark everything himself so you don't need to chalk anything unless he asks. It also really helps him if you let him use your ladder since he's really quick and likes to be efficient. He said not to mark the roof prior either. Been an IA for 10 ye\nPA Paul Vaccaro\nHANCOCK\nLadder Assist \nN\nN\nOlder late 40s white guy had a lisp really into wrestling. Really cool guy very Conversive. He acknowledged my chalk marks took photos. All in all real good AM drives dark blue Chevy Silverado \nClay\nPATRIOT CLAIMS\nLadder Assist\nN\nYes\nThis dude is absolutely the boy he literally said \"soft spot in heaven for contractors that chalk day before.\" This was Allstate though so the test squares have to be done the right way 6 quadrants. He will look out for you with a solid report if the damage is good\nLuke\nUSAA ALLCAT\nIA\nY\nY\nThis guy is super cool longish blond hair. He was very thorough and taught me about Z flashing. He literally smiled so big when he saw the gutter hail damage. He did a very thorough inspection and documented every lick of damage. Clearly trying to buy. Get him the hover he will love that and he agreed with all my test square markings and even found more 15+ hail every test square every elevation. This dude is the fkn goat just make sure you filed a claim with good damage.\nDustin Jones\nHomesite\nAdjuster\nN\nY\nSuper nice guy. Middle aged very well. First in the insurance industry told me a lot of insurance companies are moving to wind and hail. Deductibles. He actually hopped up on the roof with the ladder assist and I inspect some damages, and then made decision on the spot for full replacement\nKyle\nProgressive \nField Adjuster\nN\nY\nReally friendly and personable. We had a great conversation about how there should be any bad blood between contractors and adjusters. Helped me out big time getting the roof approved and letting the HO know about her separate wind/hail deductible she didn't know she had. \nTerrence \nHancock \nLadder assist\nN\nY\nSuper cool guy. Is always down to help the contractor out as best as he can but he will not agree with what obviously is not hail damage. If you show him good damage he will write that report in our favor and if there isn't good damage don't get mad at him for not agreeing with it. He is definitely the boy \nWalter morales\nSeek now\nInspector\nN\nY\nVery cool. Allows us to point out damages. He documents everything and seems to be on our side. Very informative to new guys. He's the man\nRobert Sullivan \nUSAA\nIA\nY\nY\nHe said he's been doing this stuff his entire life. Wasn't the best first experience with him. Cedar shake hail claim. The HO lives overseas and was adamant about trying although the damage wasn't great. This guy was a little blown about no great hail damage. Ultimately he is there to buy so if you got good damage then you're in for a good one. If you don't got good enough damage then let this guy know up front the minute you meet him he will respect you more for it\nBrandon Loa\nSeekNow\nLadder Assist\nN\nY\nSuper cool dude drives an F150. Long brown hair and beard. He definitely is the boy. Conversed with me and took pics of the majority of my damages. It was a ten pitch roof though and his pads were shot so he wasn't really scaling it the best but none the less it was a good experience with him. I even left him a good review via the text I got after we were finished. \nEric \nSeekNow\nLadder Assist \nN\nY\nSuper cool guy. Glasses bearded, stocky dude. He genuinely is out to help you and will take any pics that you need. He kind of reminds me of the super cool uncle. This dude is one of the boys forsure \nMalik (Marouane)\nSeekNow\nLadder Assist \nN\nN\nHad him with USAA. He saw me and the adjuster shooting the shit as he arrived which I feel eased him down some and made him comfortable. He was super cool we talked about fishing and his kids and he told me as we were going up the roof he was going to give me the roof before even looking at all the test squares! At the end he said he's calling all hail absolutely the fkn boy :) Anthony with USAA that was there immediately told the Ho There was another to give her a full roof replacement of a two year\nBen\nStatefarm\nTraveling IA \nN\nY\nInitially, we had to reschedule the adjuster meeting. He was super cool about that. He was a little bit late today he called to apologizing showed up. Didn'But did answer any questions. I asked he's a pretty detailed guy probably been doing this for a long time because State Farm called him asking for help all the way from Florida. I really don't know how it all went, but he definitely chalked up storm damage and didn't say whether he agreed or not, but he measured a lot of stuff I would say guys not a bad adju\nErik \nHancock\nInspector\nN\nY\nThis guys the boy. Will help you chalk stuff up and give you the best chance of approval. Has neck tats and just chatted about soccer the whole time. \nMichael Vi\nLiberty Mutual \nAdjuster \nN \nY\nSeems like a solid dude. Approved my wind and hail claim out in Ashburn but damage has to be legit. Not the type of guy to buy for the sake of buying\nSylias (Sigh-les) York\nUSAA ALLCAT\nTraveling IA from Idaho\nY\nY\nIf you have Sylias (Sigh-Las) York with USAA ALLCAT, he loves when you chalk up all the metals beforehand and is looking to buy anything and everything! You can also mark shingles only with a dot next to it and then he can mark it himself after to do the test square. Heâ€™s coming from Idaho with a rodeo championship belt and is gonna be here for two more weeks. Also have the Hover esx report request beforehand so you can email it to him when he gets there. Iâ€™ll put this in the adjuster notes too\nFatima \nLiberty\nDesk adjuster \nY\nN\nWell she was adamant about still inspecting the elevations and exterior while it was raining since she was already there. Ofcourse the hail hits looked distorted and not really as visible and then when I tried to wipe the water away she told me don't wipe it -_- like tf? How are you going to see it then? Then she pulled the ehh I'm seeing a pattern here that's not looking consistent with hail and then I was like are you serious? This is definitely hail and if you were to see the roof metals you wouldn't be doubting th\nStran\nUSAA\nIA Texas Boy!\nY\nY\nDude is out here from Texas literally to buy any and everything you definitely want this guy!!\nWarner\nSeek now\nIA\nN\nY\nPretty criminal, talked down on our ownership because we are not taught how to vandalize. Plus is he is pushing for the buy negative is it's not honest. May need to redo phot report if done prior to adjuster meeting due to new \"damages\"\nJohn \nHancock \nLadder assist \nN\nY\nThis dude is absolutely the boy as long as you give him some good collateral and your test squares look really good and you're not marking any hail on shingles that have fibers inside he will agree and help you win that shit every time we see each other and a hug and a big what's up my boy!

I showed him damage to the gutter and he did not acknowledge it in his report. Not mean but unprofessional. Did not want to talk to me at all. He started getting an attitude while I asked questions.\nBilly Murphy\nSeeknow \nLadder assist \nN\nN\nGuy was a contractor prior to Seeknow. Really cool dude, very detailed. \nPatrick (Reed)\nSeeknow\nLadder assist\nN\nN\nI've had him twice, makes own squares lets you mark inside them. Do not mark without him being in roof/without permission. Easy to work with. Got along with him well.\nWilliam \nPatriot claims \nLadder assist \nN\nY\nBeen doing this a while. Heâ€™s easy going though and somewhat talkative. I got two approvals with him. Sent him photos he added to his file that we forgot to take pics of and he did so. He will lookout. If itâ€™s Allstate let him do the test squares just mark the hail once done. Heâ€™s good\nJeremy Polluck\nSeekNow \nLadder Assist\nN\nY\nBlack guy dreads absolutely the boy \nGarrett\nHancock\nInsepctor\nN\nY\nVery laid back, allows you to mark up the roof prior to him getting there. Very easy to get along with as long as you allow him to do whatever he needs to do while he is up on the roof. Been in the industry for 7 years. \nAndrew wells \nSeeknow \nInspector \nY\nY\nDudes pretty swoll super cool guy definitely went out of his way to give the best report as in report the shingles as in very bad condition not reparable and the rest squares we did he made sure his had the most this guy is got but make sure you're showing him some good storm damage because he knows his shit \nZach brown \nHancock \nInspector \nY\nY\nBob Ross Fro.
