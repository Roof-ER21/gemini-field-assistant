Contractors enrolled in GAF certification programs are not employees or agents of GAF, and 
GAF does not control or otherwise supervise these independent businesses. Contractors 
may receive benefits, such as loyalty rewards points and discounts on marketing tools from 
GAF for participating in the program and offering GAF enhanced warranties, which require 
the use of a minimum amount of GAF products. Your dealings with a Contractor, and any 
services they provide to you, are subject to the Contractor Terms of Use. Visit gaf.com/gaf-
