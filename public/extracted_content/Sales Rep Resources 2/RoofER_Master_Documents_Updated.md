## Page 3

Contingency & Claim Authorization
After the claim: “Okay, perfect! Like they said, an adjuster will be reaching out to you in the next 24
to 48 hours to schedule the inspection. The absolute most important part of this process is that I am
at this inspection. Insurance companies don’t want to pay out. They are trying to mitigate their
losses after storms. I am there as your representation to make sure you get a fair shake.
Turn the iPad so you and the homeowner can see. 
“This basic/simple agreement backs you as the homeowner by guaranteeing you that your only cost
will be your deductible if we get you fully approved. If it is a partial approval or denial, first we will
fight and jump through the necessary hoops to turn that into a full approval; but if we are not able to
get you fully approved, this contract is null and void and you do not owe us a penny.”
“What’s in it for us, is we just want to get to do the work. This agreement commits you to using us if
we hold up our end of the bargain and achieve a full-approval.”
You sign
They sign
“This next form is our Claim Authorization form. Very simple, it allows us to communicate with your
insurance company. I’ll be here for the inspection and we will also communicate with them through
email and phone calls so you don’t have to be a middle-man. Of course, I’ll always keep you looped
in with our communication by CCing you in all emails and updating you on any conversations we
have.
They sign
Press Submit enter password “roofer” if it asks.
“Alright, we are all set! Again, the most important part of this process is that I am here when the
insurance company comes out. Ideally you can have them call me to schedule that directly. If they
call me, great! But, regardless, please get the adjuster’s information (name, email, phone number)
and send that over to me so that I can communicate with them before the inspection. If they insist
on scheduling with you, go ahead and pencil in a time and avoid these times and days [provide your
schedule]
Answer any questions that the HO may have
“Thank you, sir/ma’am, looking forward to seeing you on the day of inspection, you have my contact
information on my card if you need anything else.

## Page 4

Full Approval Estimate Phone Call
This is the call you will make to your HO as soon as you receive the estimate
“Hello sir/ma’am! It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. Congratulations, I am glad we were able to
ensure that your insurance company fully approved your roof/siding/gutters/etc replacement!
“So the next steps are, as I mentioned last time we met:
“One of our Project Coordinators will be reaching out to you to schedule a Project Meeting to go
over your full scope of work.
“Based on the estimate, your insurance company will be sending you [ACV AMOUNT] shortly. This
will be used as your down payment. With that, we can start all of your work! When they send you
that check, just hold on to it until your meeting with our Project Coordinator who will help with all the
next steps.
“Our estimating team will also be sending in supplements to the insurance company based on items
they may have missed. This includes Code Items such as IWS and Drip Edge. And don’t worry!
Even if for some reason they do not approve these amounts, we will still do all the necessary work
and never charge you for it. As we talked about earlier, your only cost out of this will be your
deductible once we finish all the work.
“Upon completion of the installation, we will review and inspect all of our work to ensure it is to your
satisfaction. Then we will send in a completion form once you sign off on the complete project.
That’s when the insurance company will release the remaining funds minus your deductible. So
your final payment will only be those funds plus your deductible.
“Any questions so far, sir/ma’am?”
Answer any questions
“Great! Again, I am glad that we were able to make this happen for you, now you get to experience
the quality that Roof ER always delivers, at only the cost of your deductible after your whole project
is complete!” Potentially mention additional work that they may want to add.
Answer any additional questions or engage in any conversation the HO starts.
“Also, if you know anyone else that I can help, have them reach out to me! You have my card - they
can call, text, or email me and I can inspect their property to see if they have the same qualifying
damage and I can walk them through the same process I have walked you through!
Engage in any conversation that this starts
“Awesome!
If you haven’t already put up a yard sign: “Would you mind if I put up a yard sign next time I’m in
your area? This will definitely help other companies already know that you’re working with someone
and hopefully eliminate anyone else from knocking your door asking about your roof/siding.”
“Look out for the communication from one of our Project Coordinators so you can get that Project
Meeting scheduled to go over all the next steps and your full scope of work. Congratulations again
and have a great day!”

Initial Pitch
5 Non-negotiables with every pitch
Who you are
Who we are and what we do (Roof ER)
Make it relatable
What you’re there to do (an inspection)
Go for the close (them agreeing to the inspection)
Knock on door/ring doorbell
As they are opening the door, smile and wave.
“Hi, how are you? My Name is ________ with Roof- ER we’re a local roofing company that
specializes in helping homeowners get their roof (and siding) replaced, paid for by their insurance!”
Generic:
“We’ve had a lot of storms here in Northern Virginia/Philadelphia/Maryland over the past few
months that have done a lot of damage!
“We’re already working with your neighbors. We’ve been able to help them get fully approved
through their insurance company to have their roof and/or siding replaced.”
(Go to line marked with ^)
-OR-
Specific
“Were you home for the storm we had in ___. Wait for answer
If yes “It was pretty crazy right?! Wait for answer
If no: “Oh no worries at all, we get that all the time.
If yes move on to next line marked with *
If no “That’s good! It was a pretty bad one!”
*“We’re working with a lot of your neighbors in the area. We’ve been able to help them get fully
approved through their insurance company to have their roof (and siding) replaced.”
^“While I’m here, in the neighborhood, I am conducting a completely free inspection to see if you
have similar, qualifiable damage. If you do, I’ll take a bunch of photos and walk you through the rest
of the process. If you don’t, I wouldn’t want to waste your time, I wouldn’t want to waste mine! I will
at least leave giving you peace of mind that you’re in good shape.”
Once they agree to let you do the inspection:, “Alright! It will take me about 10 - 15 minutes. I’m
gonna take a look around the perimeter of your home, then grab the ladder, and take a look at your
roof.

## Page 6

Go in for a handshake. What was your name again? [Their name] great to meet you, again I am
(your name). Oh and by the way do you know who your insurance company is”? Wait for their
answer, “Great! We work with those guys all the time.”
“Here’s my card/flier, look us up while I’m conducting the inspection! I will give you a knock when I
finish up and show you what I’ve found.”
Without any hesitation, move into inspection. (See Inspection and Post-Inspection Script for
detailed next steps.)

you should do is a judgment call. Getting enough photos to sell the homeowner is most important. It
doesn’t matter how quickly you are able to complete the inspection if you don’t have enough
damage-photos for the homeowner to be on board with filing the claim.
§Flashlight
 \
Post-Inspection Pitch
Knock on the door 
“Hey _______, so I have a bunch of photos to show you. First I walked around the perimeter of the
house  to look for collateral damage. I’ll also show you the collateral damage we found on the
roof.”  Say this while going through through house number and overview photos
Start showing the pictures of damage to screens, gutters, downspouts, and soft metals
“While this damage functionally isn’t a big deal, it really helps build a story. Think of us like lawyers
and this collateral damage is the evidence that builds the case which helps us get the roof (and
siding) approved.”

## Page 8

Continue to slide through collateral damage photos
“Here are the photos of the damage to your shingles. Anything I have circled means its hail damage
(IF there were any wind damaged shingles or missing shingles say:) and  anything I have slashed
means its wind damage. 
Remain on a photo of hail damage as you explain the following
“This is exactly what we look for when we're looking for hail damage. If you notice, the divot is
circular  in nature.   Even if this damage doesn’t look like a big deal, what happens over time, these
hail divots fill with water, freeze…., when water freezes it expands and breaks apart the shingle
which will eventually lead to leaks.  That is why your insurance company is responsible and your
policy covers this type of damage.” 
Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail. 
“As you can see there is quite a bit of damage.  
Start slowly swiping through all the pictures of hail.  
If there was wind damage or missing shingles, say the following:
“Now here are the wind damaged shingles. You have both shingles that are creased from the wind
lifting them up and shingles that have completely been blown off.”
Show the pictures of wind damaged and/or missing shingles (if applicable)
Now show them pictures of the granules in gutters and downspouts
“As you can see here, granules have filled up your gutters. These granules are supposed to be
what’s protecting your home. When wind and hail hits your roof, it knocks out these granules which
reduces the lifespan of your roof.”
“This is very similar to damage to ________’s home and/or the rest of the approvals we’ve gotten in
the area”.  
“With that being said, insurance companies are always looking for ways to mitigate their losses. It’s
unfortunate but that’s how they make money. The most important part of this process is that when
your insurance company comes out to run their inspection, we are here as storm experts to make
sure you as a homeowner get a fair shake. If they are missing anything we make sure they see all
the damage that I  just showed you.” 
“What I’m going to do now is run to my car, grab my iPad and we can get this process started”! Go
get iPad 
As you approach back to the house/homeowner ask “Is there a place we could sit down for 5-10
Minutes”?
Once you are in the house, spend some time building rapport as you get settled. 
“Okay, so first I am going to grab some of your basic information for our system. Then we can let
your insurance company know about the damagel”. 
Gather information from the homeowner:
Full name

## Page 9

Address
Phone Number  
E-mail
Insurance Company
“Do you happen to know your deductible? If not, no big deal at all”! 
After you have collected all the information:
Ask if they have the app or if they have the login to the website.
If not, use the Homeowner Information Sheet to prep the HO. As you are writing or typing the
information for the HO to use on the call, explain each part to them.
As much as possible, use HO’s phone to make the call

Partial Estimate/Denial Phone Call
This is the call you will make to your HO as soon as you receive the estimate
“Hello sir/ma’am! It’s [YOUR NAME] with Roof ER. How’s it going?”
“Great, well we just received the decision from the insurance company. We’re going to have to take
some steps to get this turned around. I have already submitted my photo report that demonstrates
the damage to your property and the need to replace your whole roof, so hopefully they review and
approve that. Could you please reach out to the adjuster to see if they were able to review my
report?”
After HO answers. “Thank you! During that call, please let them know that you disagree with their
current decision and would like to have your property reinspected if they are not able to update their
current decision to a full approval based on the photo report that I sent them.”
If there are some approved shingles:
“So we will also be conducting an iTel and Repair Attempt.
“An iTel is where we will take a shingle off your roof and send it in to get tested to verify that it is
discontinued. Since it is discontinued, the only effective way to restore your property would be with
a full roof replacement.
“At that time, I will also take a video of us removing and replacing that shingle. This Repair Attempt
video will demonstrate to the insurance company that your roof is not repairable and therefore
would need to be fully replaced.
“To get those scheduled, I will need you to sign these 2 documents allowing us to do that. When
you see the documents, it will have a cost attached, but don’t worry! Read the bold print and you will
see that you, as the homeowner, are never responsible for this cost.”
Schedule a time to meet with the HO to sign or let them know you will be sending it out for eSign.
Task the proper people for eSign, if necessary.
“We will definitely be putting in the work to give you the highest chance of getting this turned
around. I definitely believe your roof has the damage that warrants a full replacement. But, of
course, insurance companies are billion dollar, publicly traded companies that will try to save as
much money as they can on every claim. That is why it is great that you are working with us since
we know the proper steps to ensure that you are adequately taken care of by your insurance
company!”
Answer any questions or concerns the HO has.
“Alright, so let me know how the phone call goes with your adjuster and I’ll start working on my end
to put everything together to get this turned around. Thank you, sir/ma’am, goodbye!”

## Page 11

Post Adjuster Meeting Script
This is the conversation you will have with the HO after an adjuster meeting
If moving to Estimate Pending:
“Great! The Adjuster/Ladder Assist identified all the same damage as me. You will be receiving an
email from us shortly saying that you’ve been fully approved. Within a few days you should receive
the itemized estimate from the Insurance Company. Once you receive that, you can forward that to
me. This is going to include every line item that the insurance company believes is needed to make
you whole again. To you this is going to look like gibberish. But, don’t worry, that’s what we’re here
for. If for some weird reason the desk adjuster does not write it for a full approval after this
inspection, I will take the steps necessary to get it turned around! Any questions on that,
sir/ma’am?”
Answer any questions
“When the insurance company generates their estimate, it will also typically trigger the release of
the first payment. The insurance company refers to this payment as the ACV. Which stands for
Actual Cash Value. That amount will be used as your down payment. The remaining funds are held
by the insurance company until we complete the work. They refer to these remaining funds as
Depreciation. Which is not “depreciation” as most would think about it, it’s just their way of holding
on to some of the funds to make sure the work gets done.
“At the same time our office will be reviewing your entire project along with my photos and the
insurance estimate. As I’ve mentioned, insurance companies are always trying to save money. We
usually find specific line items that are missing. Most commonly, code items like IWS and Drip
Edge. We will supplement for all the items needed to complete your project to code and our
manufacturer’s specifications. Don’t worry, like we have agreed to from the beginning, we
guarantee you that you would not have to cover any of these costs even if the insurance company
were to deny our supplement. [Which does not happen.]
“Once our office has completed your job review, which takes 2 - 3 business days, your job will be
assigned to one of our Project Coordinators. They will reach out to schedule a project meeting
where they will walk you through all of the finer details. This is the fun part where you will get to pick
our products and colors. *Of course if you have anything else you would like us to do beyond the
insurance approval, your Project Coordinator could price that out for you.*
“Your install date will typically be 4 - 6 weeks after your Project Meeting. After you submit that initial
payment from the insurance company, we’ll reach out to get your project scheduled!
“I know that was a lot of information. The most important thing from here is forwarding the estimate
as soon as you get it. Of course if you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to
reach out.
Answer any questions that they may have.
“A great way for me to help assist some of your neighbors, would be if I could put up a yard sign!
Would you mind if I put one up? Thank you, sir/ma’am!”
Submit your Photo Report and Claim Authorization to the adjuster with an effective email. Use
Post-AM-Email-Template if you need to.
If moving to Decision Pending:
“So, we just finished our inspection. The Adjuster/Ladder Assist will be sending their report to a
desk adjuster and will be making a final decision. Once they make a decision, they will write up an

## Page 12

itemized estimate and should send that over to you. Once you receive that, please forward that over
to me. They can be a bit hard to read, so I’ll be able to walk through all of that with you.
“If it comes back as anything other than a full approval, I’ll take the necessary steps to make sure it
gets turned around! There are a lot of steps we can take from here, which we can go over once we
receive the estimate.
“I will go over all this information again once we receive the estimate and have a more clear picture
of what the next steps will be.”
Answer any questions they may have
“Great! So, if you have any questions between now and when you get your estimate, please reach
out! And, again, once you receive that from the insurance company, forward that over to me so I
can review that with you. Thank you sir/ma’am! Have a great day!”
Submit your Photo Report and Claim Authorization to the adjuster with an effective email. Use
Post-AM-Email-Template if you need to.

Filming Repair Attempt Video
Before you begin filming, ask the Field Tech (Francisco or Ishmael) to point out which of the
surrounding shingles will be affected by the extraction. Mark the damaged tab (if applicable) and
mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.
Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle.
Start recording, “...Here we are at [HOMEOWNER’S HOUSE] performing a repair attempt on this
storm damaged shingle. As you can see I have pre-marked every tab that will sustain unavoidable
creasing due to the brittleness of the roof. Go ahead and get started Francisco/Ishmael”
Film the entire area where repair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low
down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process.
Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount of granule loss running down
the roof.
Once the new shingle has been installed, hover the camera over the shingles and wipe your hand
back and forth gently over the top of each tab that was pried up. Trace your finger along the crease
and show it on camera, explain how each tab has now been mechanically creased and confirms the
roof failed a “brittle test”.
Once you have finished recording your video. Take close-up after pictures of the browns above the
replaced shingle. Draw an arrow to where the crease is on the shingle or point to it for the picture.

only on roof slopes of two units vertical in 12 units horizontal (17-percent slope) or greater."
The Rear slope approved for replacement has Steepness Pitch of 1/12; Therefore Flat/Rubber/TPO
roofing must be installed to be compliant with State Building Code

The 2018 IRC
Chapter 7 Wall Covering
R703.1 General. Exterior walls shall provide the building with a weather-resistant exterior wall
envelope. The exterior wall envelope shall include flashing as described in Section R703.4.
R703.1.1 Water resistance. The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed in a
manner that prevents the accumulation of water within the wall assembly by providing a
water-resistant barrier behind the exterior veneer as required by Section R703.2 and a means of
draining to the exterior water that enters the assembly.
Importance of Moisture Management
R703.2 Water-resistive barrier. One layer of No. 15 asphalt felt, free from holes and breaks,
complying with ASTM D226 for Type I felt or other approved water-resistive barrier shall be applied
over studs or sheathing of all exterior walls. Such felt or material shall be applied horizontally, with
the upper layer lapped over the lower layer not less than 2 inches (51mm). Where joints occur, felt
shall be lapped not less than 6 inches (152mm). The felt or other approved material shall be
continuous to the top of walls and terminated at penetrations and building appendages in a manner
to meet the requirements of the exterior wall envelope as described in Section R703.1.
R703.4 Flashing. Approved corrosion-resistant flashing shall be applied shingle-fashion in a
manner to prevent the entry of water into the wall cavity or penetration of water to the building
structural framing components. Self-adhered membranes used as flashing shall comply with AAMA
(Ameri-can Architectural Manufacturers Association) 711. Fluid-applied membranes used as
flashing in exterior walls shall comply with AAMA 714. The flashing shall extend to the surface of
the exterior wall finish. Approved corrosion-resistant flashings shall be installed at:
Exterior window and door openings. Flashing at exterior window and door openings shall extend to
the surface of the exterior wall finish or to the water-resistive barrier complying with Section R703.2
for subsequent drainage. Mechanically attached flexible flashings shall comply with AAMA 712.
R703.7.3 Water-resistive barriers. Water-resistive barriers shall be installed as required in Section
R703.2 and, where applied over wood-based sheathing, shall include a water-resistive
vapor-permeable barrier with a performance at least equivalent to two layers of Grade D paper. The
individual layers shall be installed independently such that each layer provides a separate
continuous plane and any flashing (installed in accordance with Section R703.4) intended to drain
to the water-resistive barrier is directed between the layers.
Exceptions:
Where the water-resistive barrier that is applied over wood-based sheathing has a water resistance
equal to or greater than that of 60-minute Grade D paper and is separated from the stucco by an
intervening, substantially non-water-absorbing layer or designed drainage space.

Arbitration Information
Binding Arbitration
Legally enforceable like a court decision.
Both parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final.
No appeal is typically allowed (except in rare cases like fraud or misconduct).
Once the arbitrator rules, the losing party must comply — often enforced in court if needed.
Example: An insurance company and a homeowner agree to resolve a roof damage dispute via
binding arbitration. The arbitrator awards $12,000 to the homeowner. The carrier must pay that
amount, with no second opinion or further negotiation.
Non-Binding Arbitration
The arbitrator’s decision is essentially a recommendation.
Either party can reject the outcome and proceed to litigation or appraisal.
Often used as a step before filing a lawsuit, especially when parties are still open to negotiating.
Example: The arbitrator awards the homeowner $10,000. The insurance company disagrees and
decides to proceed with litigation. The homeowner is not bound to accept the award either.
Important for Insurance Claims:
Binding arbitration clauses are rare in standard homeowners policies.
Most policies prefer appraisal (for valuation disputes) or litigation.
Virginia and Maryland allow arbitration, but carriers must clearly disclose and mutually agree to it —
it can’t be forced unilaterally in most claim scenarios.

To whom it may concern,
Please see the attached video link and photo report of the attempted repair for the claim number
[#_____]. As can be clearly seen in the video and pictures, the homeowner's roof sustained
additional damage during the attempted repairs. This confirms a failed brittle test for the shingles,
indicating irreparability.
With this fact established, your estimate as it currently stands would not actually fix the damages,
but would in fact further compromise the integrity of the roof as a whole. Therefore I have gone
ahead and attached an estimate below that accurately reflects the full scope of work necessary to
make our mutual client whole again.
YouTube Link:
↓[USE THIS PARAGRAPH ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES]↓
I also ask that you take note of the before and after pictures of the attempted repair. Due to the
brittleness of the roof in general, during the repair the two rows of shingles above the one we were
attempting to replace sustained unavoidable mechanical creasing. These photos clearly
demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs will inevitably
do further damage to surrounding shingles.
1. These can be seen in the updated photo report under the "Brittle Test" section, and best shown
in Photos:(___)
OR
2. Please find these photos attached below.
I kindly ask that you review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so
we can begin to move forward with the necessary full [Roof AND/OR Siding] replacement to restore
our mutual client's property to pre-storm condition.
If we can provide any additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER. I am the contractor assisting [CUSTOMER’S NAME]. Attached
you will find an iTel report [AND any additional documents if you attach them.]
[Use the following APPLICABLE arguments]
Per the attached iTel report, there are no similar matches available which makes a patch repair
impossible
Per the attached iTel report, the existing shingle is discontinued. We have attempted to contact the
suppliers listed on the report to secure the suggested samples, however each supplier noted [they
do not carry the suggested product/the suggested product would need to be special-ordered by the
pallet, meaning the costs to do so would be more exorbitant than simply replacing the roof]. As a
result, the approved scope of work cannot be completed as currently written.
(Homeowner's) shingles are the English-dimension architectural shingles which are no longer in
production. The new metric-dimension shingles have a larger exposure size and for that reason,
cannot be mixed with the existing shingles via a repair. If we try to repair with the new shingles, the
sealant on the shingle above would not secure to the correct portion of the new underlying shingle.
The sealant would be secured to the granules on the underlying shingle - any reputable contractor
knows a proper repair cannot be completed in this fashion.
Please review these findings and revise your estimate accordingly so we can begin to move forward
with the full replacement for [HOMEOWNER’S NAME]. If we can provide additional information,
please let us know. Thank you for your time and for working with us to assist [HOMEOWNER’S

This is [REP NAME] with Roof ER. I am the contractor assisting [CUSTOMER’S NAME]. Attached
you will find [MAKE SURE TO EDIT THIS SECTION FOR WHAT DOCUMENTS YOU ARE
ACTUALLY ATTACHING] my photo report [AND/OR], an iTel Report, [AND/OR] a repair estimate
that includes the siding.
[INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO YOUR EMAIL]
Damage
You will find our photo report in the list of attachments citing additional damage not accounted for in
(insurance)'s original estimate. This damage is consistent with what has already been approved
which leaves us and the homeowner unsure why these findings were left off of the estimate.
[Additional details as needed]
Discontinued
This estimate is for a full siding replacement due to the existing siding being discontinued. Per the
attached iTel report, there are no similar matches available and so our estimate accounts for all
elevations of siding.
The current siding is discontinued. The similar siding that is available would have to be special
ordered and paint matched. Because of those things, it would not be a cost-effective solution to
restore [HOMEOWNER’s] siding. The only way to effectively make them whole again would be with
full siding replacement.
Code/Housewrap
Per building code, we are required to install a house wrap on exterior wall sheathing to prevent
moisture from getting to the building envelope. Further, we are required to follow the manufacturer's
installation instructions while applying the weather barrier. These instructions state we must overlap
Housewrap 6" over any outside corners. This would require us to remove the existing aluminum
outside corner and detach the aluminum panels on the adjacent run that meet at that corner post.
This is not only impractical, but also impossible without causing further damage to metal siding
panels, as they will inevitably sustain damage during the removal process. Due to this
consequential damage, we have submitted our estimate for a full siding replacement
Please review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly so we can begin
to move forward with the full replacement for [HOMEOWNER’S NAME]. If we can provide additional
information, please let us know. Thank you for your time and for working with us to assist
[HOMEOWNER’S NAME] in restoring their property effectively after the loss they have

Filming Repair Attempt Video
Before you begin filming, ask the Field Tech (Francisco or Ishmael) to point out which of the
surrounding shingles will be affected by the extraction. Mark the damaged tab (if applicable) and
mark the bottom right corner with chalk of every shingle the Field Tech points out.
Before you begin filming; take a before shot of the area where you will be extracting the shingle.
Start recording, state the Homeowners name and house number. “...Here we are at
[HOMEOWNER’S HOUSE at 1234 (street name)] performing a repair attempt on this storm
damaged shingle. As you can see I have pre-marked every tab that will sustain unavoidable
creasing due to the brittleness of the roof. Go ahead and get started Francisco/Ishmael”
Film the entire area where repair is going to occur, then go from the Wide camera shot to a low
down side view camera angle, to show how the shingles get bent back/pried up during the process.
Make sure to show on camera or explicitly mention the high amount of granule loss running down
the roof.
Once the new shingle has been installed, hover the camera over the shingles and wipe your hand
back and forth gently or blow over the top of each tab that was pried up. Trace your finger along the
crease and show it on camera, explain how each tab has now been mechanically creased and
confirms the roof failed a “brittle test”. (picture below)
Once you have finished recording your video. Take close-up after pictures of the rows above the
replaced shingle. Draw an arrow to where the crease is on the shingle or point to it for the picture.
(see good examples of after pics below email template)
To whom it may concern,
Please see the attached video link and photos of the attempted repair for the claim number
(#__________).
As can be clearly seen in the evidence provided, the homeowner's roof sustained additional
damage during the attempted repairs. Thus confirming a failed brittle test for the shingles, indicating
irreparability for the roof as a whole.
With this fact established, your current estimate does not adequately address the needs of this roof.
Performing further patch repairs as [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME] has suggested will
unintentionally, yet unavoidably, cause further extensive damage to surrounding shingles.
Therefore I have gone ahead and attached an estimate that accurately reflects the full scope of
work necessary to make our mutual client whole again.
YouTube Link: (watch this for a good example)
I also ask that you take note of the attached before and after pictures of the attempted repair. These
photos clearly demonstrate the brittleness of this roof, and moving forward with further patch repairs
will inevitably do further unavoidable damage to surrounding shingles.
Please review these findings and revise your estimate/scope of work accordingly, so we can begin
to move forward with the full roof replacement for [HOMEOWNER NAME]. If we can provide any
additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out.

When you need a Hover ESX, XML, or PDF to send to your adjuster, please task Brandon, Danny,
Ford, or Reese to approve your Hover. Please state in your task if it is roof only or roof and siding.
After the Hover is approved, you will receive an email from Hover with the PDF. Once you receive
that, it means your Hover is ready (if it is roof and siding, it will take a little bit longer to have the
siding added as well.)
Once the Hover is complete, you will be able to download your own ESX, XML, or PDF. You will
also be able to see if your Hover is still processing and not ready for download yet.
You will do this through your internet browser; this can be done on a computer, ipad, or on your
phone. Go to the website: Hover.to
Once you go there, search your customer’s Job ID to find your customer. See the screenshot
below. The Job ID is 6902
If you manually created the hover (which you should not be doing) you will have to just search for
the customer’s hover that you manually created.
Once you open the file, you will click “export”. See screenshot below
You will then download the ESX. See screenshot below
ESX is at the very bottom. Once you click that checkbox next to it, press download.
The most effective way to get this to your adjuster is to:
Email this file to yourself.
Download the document(s) on your computer, phone or iPad.
Compose a new email and send it to your adjuster. (This way you can write the subject, write the
note, and it should have your signature at the bottom of the email.)

Insurance Process Steps & Timeline
*** Please note that every insurance company/ individual adjuster has slightly different timeline
based on multiple variables. Below is what we can typically expect:
Step 1: Schedule Adjuster Meeting
Assigned insurance adjuster will reach out within 1-3 business days to schedule their inspection of
your property
If you have interior or would like to make sure you are home for the inspection, please schedule and
let me know so I can fit it into my calendar
Otherwise, please have the adjuster call me directly to schedule
THE most important part to me helping you get fully approved… is that I am here for the insurance
company’s inspection.
Step 2: Adjuster Meeting
This meeting will typically be scheduled within 1-2 weeks of filing the claim varying based on the
adjuster’s current work load.
I will arrive 30 minutes prior to the scheduled adjuster meeting time to set up my ladder.
After the inspection, we will knock on your door to recap our inspection and to communicate the
next steps. If you are not home, I will call you to let you know how things went.
Step 3: Approved Scope of Work
Within 5 business days, the insurance company will provide an itemized estimate of the approved
scope of work.
If we have not received anything within a week of the adjuster meeting, we will begin following up
with you and the insurance company directly
Once you have received their written documentation please email that directly to myself and
