---

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I change the personality tone?
**A:** Yes! Edit `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `/config/s21Personality.ts` to adjust traits, tone, and communication style.

### Q: How do I test different welcome messages?
**A:** Clear localStorage and reload. Time-based greetings will show based on system clock.

### Q: Can I add custom query types?
**A:** Absolutely! Add to `CONTEXTUAL_RESPONSES` and update `detectQueryType()` function.

### Q: Will this affect API costs?
**A:** No! The system prompt is sent once per conversation. No additional API calls.

### Q: How do I turn off time-based greetings?
**A:** Modify `getWelcomeMessage()` in `s21Personality.ts` to always return one message.

### Q: Can I have different personalities for different users?
**A:** Not currently, but you could add user preference detection in a future enhancement.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Welcome message is generic
```javascript
// Check if personality file is imported
import { personalityHelpers } from '../config/s21Personality';
```

### AI responses still robotic
```javascript
// Verify SYSTEM_PROMPT is being used
console.log(systemPrompt);
// Should show full personality definition
```

### Query type not detected
```javascript
// Test detection manually
console.log(personalityHelpers.detectQueryType("your query here"));
```

### Time-based greeting wrong
```javascript
// Check system time
console.log(new Date().getHours());
```
