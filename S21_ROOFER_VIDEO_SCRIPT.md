## Chapter 1: Susan Chat - Your AI Assistant

### What is Susan?

Susan, also known as SA21, is your personal AI assistant. Think of her as your expert colleague who's always available, never gets tired, and has instant answers to any roofing question you can imagine.

### Why Use Susan?

Imagine you're on a customer's roof and they ask about the warranty differences between GAF Timberline and CertainTeed Landmark shingles. Instead of saying "I'll get back to you," you pull out your phone, ask Susan, and give the customer an expert answer in seconds. That's the power of Susan.

### How to Access Susan

Click "Chat" in the left sidebar, or tap the chat icon on your home screen. The chat interface opens immediately with Susan ready to help.

### Using Susan: The Basics

Using Susan is as simple as having a conversation. Type your question in the message box at the bottom and press Enter or click Send. Susan responds in seconds with detailed, professional information.

For example, type: "What causes algae streaks on asphalt shingles?" Susan will explain that algae growth is caused by Gloeocapsa Magma bacteria, thrives in humid climates, and can be prevented with algae-resistant shingles containing copper or zinc granules. She'll even suggest how to explain this to homeowners.

### Voice Features - Hands-Free Operation

Here's where Susan becomes incredibly powerful for field work. See that microphone button next to the message box? Click it, and you can speak your questions instead of typing.

Let's say you're driving between appointments. Click the microphone, ask "How do I calculate ventilation requirements for a 2000 square foot roof?" and Susan transcribes your question, processes it, and responds - all hands-free.

But here's the best part: Susan doesn't just show you text responses. She reads them aloud! Every response is automatically spoken in a natural voice, so you can keep your eyes on the road while learning.

This works on Chrome, Edge, and Safari on iOS. It's perfect for driving, walking properties, or any time your hands are full.

### What to Ask Susan

Susan excels at five types of questions:

**First, product information.** Ask things like "Compare architectural shingles to 3-tab shingles" or "What's the warranty on GAF HDZ shingles?" Susan knows product specs, warranties, and features.

**Second, technical advice.** Questions like "How do I identify hail damage?" or "What's the proper roof ventilation ratio?" Susan provides expert technical guidance.

**Third, customer situations.** Try "Customer says we're too expensive, how should I respond?" Susan gives you strategies and talking points.

**Fourth, email and documentation help.** Ask "Draft a follow-up email for a customer waiting on insurance approval" and Susan writes a professional email you can copy and send.

**Fifth, sales strategy.** Questions like "What questions should I ask during an initial consultation?" Susan provides proven sales techniques.

### Pro Tips for Better Results

The more specific your question, the better Susan's answer. Instead of "Tell me about roofs," ask "What are the top 3 roofing materials for coastal New England properties and why?"

Always provide context. Instead of "What should I do?" say "Customer got an insurance denial for wind damage but I can see obvious shingle loss. What are my next steps?"

Use Susan for practice. Ask her to give you objection scenarios and quiz you on product knowledge. She's your 24/7 training partner.

### Real-World Example

Here's how a rep used Susan yesterday: He was meeting with a customer who asked about metal roofing. He asked Susan "Pros and cons of metal roofing in Massachusetts" and within seconds had talking points about durability, energy efficiency, cost, and noise concerns. The customer was impressed with his instant expertise, and he closed a $25,000 deal.

Susan Chat is your foundation. Master this, and everything else becomes easier.

## Chapter 2: Email Generator - Professional Emails in Seconds

### The Email Challenge

How much time do you spend writing emails? Follow-ups after meetings, sending estimates, communicating with insurance adjusters, scheduling appointments. If you're like most reps, it's 30-60 minutes per day.

The Email Generator changes that. What used to take 20 minutes now takes 2.

### Accessing Email Generator

Click "Email Generator" in the sidebar, or use the Quick Actions menu (we'll cover that later). The email generator opens with six professional templates ready to use.

### The Six Templates

**Template One: Follow-Up Email.** Use this after any customer meeting or inspection. It creates a professional follow-up that recaps your conversation, confirms next steps, and keeps momentum going.

**Template Two: Estimate Email.** When you're ready to send a quote, this template presents your estimate professionally with clear pricing, scope of work, and terms.

**Template Three: Insurance Communication.** This creates professional emails for insurance adjusters and companies. Perfect for claim submissions, requesting site visits, or following up on approvals.

**Template Four: Thank You Email.** After a sale or great interaction, this generates a genuine thank-you that builds long-term relationships.

**Template Five: Schedule Meeting.** Need to set up an appointment? This template makes it easy to propose times and explain what you'll cover.

**Template Six: Custom Email.** For anything else, this template handles any email situation you encounter.

### How to Generate an Email

Let's walk through a real example. You just finished inspecting Sarah Johnson's roof at 456 Oak Street. She has hail damage and is working with State Farm on claim number 78901. You promised to send an estimate by Friday, and she wants warranty information.

Here's what you do:

**Step one:** Select "Follow-Up Email" template.

**Step two:** In the context box, type: "Met with Sarah Johnson at 456 Oak Street. Discussed roof replacement after hail damage. She's getting insurance approval from State Farm, claim 78901. Need to send estimate by Friday. She wants timeline and warranty info."

**Step three:** Click "Generate Email."

In five seconds, you have a complete professional email:

"Dear Sarah, Thank you for meeting with me yesterday to discuss your roof replacement at 456 Oak Street. I enjoyed our conversation and appreciate the opportunity to help with your hail damage repair. As we discussed, I understand you're working with State Farm on claim 78901. I'll have your detailed estimate to you by Friday as promised, including material options, labor costs, and timeline. For your project, we can typically begin within 2-3 weeks of insurance approval and complete installation in 3-5 days. Our warranty package includes a 50-year manufacturer warranty and our 10-year workmanship guarantee. I'll include full warranty details with Friday's estimate. Please call or text with any questions. Looking forward to working together!"

**Step four:** Review the email. The AI has created a professional message that hits all your key points.

**Step five:** Click "Copy to Clipboard," paste into Gmail or Outlook, and send. Done.

What used to take 20 minutes took 2.

### Quick Actions Email - The Fast Method

There's an even faster way for quick emails. Click the "Quick Actions" button (the floating red button on mobile, or in your sidebar on desktop).

Click the Email button. You'll see three simple fields: Recipient, Subject, and Instructions.

Type "Sarah" for recipient, "Follow-up on estimate" for subject, and "Following up on yesterday's meeting about roof replacement" for instructions.

Click "Send Email" and it opens the Email Generator with everything pre-filled. Generate, copy, send. Total time: 30 seconds.

### The Power of Context

The secret to great AI-generated emails is good context. The more details you provide, the better the email.

Good context includes: customer name, property address, what you discussed, specific numbers (claim numbers, square footage, pricing), promised timelines, and what the customer wants to know.

Don't worry about grammar or perfect sentences in your context. Just dump the information. The AI will turn it into professional prose.

### Real-World Impact

One of our top reps started using the Email Generator last month. He was spending 45 minutes per day on emails. Now it's 10 minutes. That's 35 extra minutes daily - almost 3 hours per week - that he spends selling instead of writing.

His close rate went up 15% because he's following up faster. While competitors take hours to send estimates, he's responding in minutes. Speed wins deals.

## Chapter 3: Document Analysis - AI-Powered Photo and Document Review

### The Inspection Documentation Problem

You inspect a roof, take 20 photos of hail damage, and need to write a damage assessment for the insurance company. Traditionally, you'd spend 30 minutes writing: "Observed multiple impact points consistent with hail damage, approximately 25-30 impacts per section, granule displacement evident..."

Or you receive a 10-page insurance denial letter and need to extract the key points. You'd read through legal language for 15 minutes.

Document Analysis changes everything.

### What Document Analysis Does

Upload photos, PDFs, insurance documents, estimates, contracts - any file - and AI analyzes it instantly. You get professional assessments, damage reports, key information extracted, and actionable insights.

### Accessing Document Analysis

Click "Upload Analysis" in the sidebar or use Quick Actions and select Upload.

### How to Use It: Roof Damage Assessment

Let's walk through analyzing roof damage photos.

You just inspected a property with suspected hail damage from the June 3rd storm. You took 5 photos showing impact points on the shingles.

**Step one:** Drag and drop all 5 photos into the upload area. Or click to browse and select them.

**Step two:** In the context box, type: "Hail damage from June 3rd storm. Property at 123 Main St. Customer claims 20+ impact points. Need damage assessment for State Farm claim 12345."

**Step three:** Click "Analyze Documents."

The AI processes your photos and generates a comprehensive damage assessment:

"DAMAGE ASSESSMENT REPORT: Multiple hail impact points visible on asphalt shingles. Approximately 25-30 impact marks per photo section. Granule loss evident in damaged areas. Some impacts show exposed fiberglass mat. Pattern consistent with 1 to 1.5 inch hail.

SEVERITY: Moderate to Severe. Damage concentration exceeds industry threshold for replacement. Multiple shingles show granule displacement. Structural integrity compromised.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Full roof replacement recommended. Document all damage with detailed photos. File insurance claim immediately. Include underlayment inspection.

INSURANCE CLAIM SUPPORT: Clear evidence of hail damage. Damage pattern consistent with storm event. Meets replacement criteria per standard policies.

NEXT STEPS: Prepare comprehensive estimate, contact insurance company, schedule adjuster visit."

**Step four:** Copy this analysis and include it in your insurance claim documentation or customer estimate.

What would have taken 30 minutes took 2.

### Analyzing Insurance Documents

Upload an insurance denial letter or policy document. Add context like "Insurance denial for claim 12345, customer Sarah Johnson."

The AI extracts: key points, reasons for denial, coverage details, appeal deadlines, and recommendations for next steps.

You immediately know what to do instead of spending 20 minutes reading legal language.

### Competitor Estimate Analysis

Customer shows you a competitor's quote. Upload it. The AI analyzes pricing, scope of work, materials proposed, warranty terms, and provides comparison points where you can differentiate.

### Pro Tips for Better Analysis

For photos: take multiple angles, get close-ups of damage, include overall roof shots, use good lighting, avoid shadows, include reference objects for scale.

For documents: upload all related files together, provide context about what you need, mention specific concerns or questions.

The better your photos and context, the better the analysis.

### Real-World Example

A rep uploaded damage photos from a commercial property. The AI identified not just hail damage but also poor installation practices from the previous roofer - something he missed during inspection. This became a key selling point: "Your current roof wasn't just damaged by hail, it was installed incorrectly. Let me show you the difference professional installation makes."

He won a $75,000 commercial contract because AI spotted what he missed.

## Chapter 4: Voice Transcription - Record and Transcribe Meetings

### Why Record Customer Conversations

How many times have you left a customer meeting and thought "Wait, did they say they'd call me or should I call them?" or "What was that adjuster's name again?"

Voice Transcription solves this. Record your customer meetings, phone calls, and conversations. Get automatic transcription plus AI analysis that extracts action items, identifies objections, analyzes customer sentiment, and recommends next steps.

It's like having a sales coach listening to every conversation.

### Accessing Voice Transcription

Click "Transcription" in the sidebar or use Quick Actions and select Voice Note.

### How to Record a Meeting

**Step one:** Before your meeting, open Voice Transcription.

**Step two:** Select meeting type: initial consultation, inspection, follow-up, closing, or other.

**Step three:** Click the microphone button to start recording.

You'll see a timer counting up and a waveform showing audio levels. The system can record up to 5 minutes per session - perfect for most customer conversations.

**Step four:** Have your conversation normally. The microphone picks up both you and your customer.

**Step five:** When finished, click the stop button.

**Step six:** Wait 30 to 60 seconds while AI transcribes and analyzes the conversation.

### What You Get: AI Analysis

After transcription, you receive a comprehensive analysis:

**Meeting Summary:** A paragraph summarizing what was discussed, main concerns, and outcomes.

**Full Transcript:** Every word spoken, formatted with timestamps.

**Action Items:** A checklist of things you need to do, automatically extracted from the conversation. "Send estimate by Friday," "Call adjuster Monday," "Follow up after insurance approval."

**Objections Identified:** Every customer concern flagged, with your response noted and whether it was resolved. This helps you see patterns in what objections you handle well and which need work.

**Customer Sentiment:** AI determines if the customer is positive, neutral, negative, or mixed based on tone and content.

**Follow-Up Needed:** Yes or no, with specific recommendations.

**Estimated Value:** If pricing was discussed, AI captures the deal value.

**Next Steps:** Specific recommendations for what to do next.

### Example Transcription Analysis

You recorded a 3-minute initial consultation. Here's what the AI provides:

"MEETING SUMMARY: Initial consultation with homeowner regarding roof replacement after recent storm damage. Customer concerned about cost and timeline. Discussed insurance claim process and warranty options. Customer interested in proceeding pending insurance approval.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Send detailed estimate by Friday
- Contact State Farm adjuster
- Schedule follow-up call Monday
- Provide warranty documentation

OBJECTIONS IDENTIFIED:
1. 'It seems expensive' - Response: Explained value of 50-year warranty - RESOLVED: Yes
2. 'How long will it take?' - Response: 3-5 days for installation - RESOLVED: Yes

CUSTOMER SENTIMENT: Positive
FOLLOW-UP NEEDED: Yes
ESTIMATED VALUE: $12,000-15,000
NEXT STEPS: Send estimate, await insurance approval, follow up Monday."

### Exporting Transcriptions

Export transcriptions in three formats:

**Markdown:** Perfect for documentation and reports.
**JSON:** For integrating with other systems.
**Plain Text:** For emails or simple sharing.

You can also download the original audio file.

### Viewing Past Transcriptions

All transcriptions are saved automatically. Click any transcript to view full details, play the audio, or export.

Search by keyword to find specific conversations. Filter by meeting type to review all initial consultations or closings.

### Pro Tips

For better transcriptions: speak clearly, minimize background noise, hold phone steady, test microphone before important calls, record in quiet environments.

What to record: customer consultations, inspection walkthroughs, phone conversations, adjuster meetings, team discussions.

### Real-World Impact

One rep records every customer interaction. When a customer called three weeks after meeting saying "You promised it would be $10,000," he pulled up the transcription, saw he actually said "$10,000 to $12,000 depending on materials chosen," and resolved the dispute immediately.

Another rep reviews her transcriptions weekly to see which objections she handles well and which need improvement. Her objection handling improved 40% in one month.

Voice Transcription is your accountability system, your memory backup, and your sales coach all in one.

## Chapter 5: Agnes - Your Objection Handling Coach

### The Objection Handling Challenge

Every sales rep faces objections. "It's too expensive." "I need to think about it." "I already got other quotes." The difference between top performers and average performers is how they handle these moments.

Agnes is your objection handling specialist. She gives you word-for-word scripts, explains the psychology behind why they work, and provides backup strategies if the customer still resists.

### Accessing Agnes

From the home page, scroll to Quick Reference section and click "Handle Objection." Agnes opens in a full-screen panel.

### Quick Objections - Instant Help

Agnes has six pre-loaded buttons for the most common objections:

**"Too expensive"** - Price objections
**"Need to think about it"** - Timing and hesitation
**"Got a denial from insurance"** - Insurance denials
**"Insurance only paid partial"** - Partial payment issues
**"Want to cancel early"** - Cancellation requests
**"Already got other quotes"** - Competition objections

Click any button and Agnes instantly provides three things:

**First:** "What to Say" - An exact, word-for-word script you can use.

**Second:** "Why It Works" - The sales psychology explanation so you understand the strategy.

**Third:** "If They Still Resist" - A backup approach if your first response doesn't close the objection.

### Example: "Too Expensive" Objection

Customer says your estimate is too expensive. You click the "Too expensive" button in Agnes.

Agnes responds:

**WHAT TO SAY:**
"I completely understand your concern, and many of our best customers felt the same way initially. But here's what they discovered - when you factor in our lifetime warranty, the premium materials that last 50% longer, and the fact that we handle all insurance paperwork saving you 20+ hours of hassle, the real question becomes: can you afford NOT to invest in quality? Let me show you exactly how this pays for itself in the first 5 years alone."

**WHY IT WORKS:**
"This validates their concern while reframing from cost to value. It uses social proof - 'best customers felt the same' - to normalize their objection. It introduces concrete benefits: warranty, materials, time savings. Most importantly, it shifts the conversation from upfront price to long-term ROI. The psychology leverages loss aversion - they start thinking about what they might lose by NOT investing."

**IF THEY STILL RESIST:**
"Ask: 'What's your biggest concern about the investment - the upfront cost, or the monthly payment structure? We have financing options that make this more affordable than you might think.' Then address their specific concern directly with numbers and show payment plans that fit their budget."

### Custom Objections

For objections not covered by the quick buttons, type the objection into the chat box.

Examples: "Customer says the timeline is too long," "They want to use their friend who's a roofer," "They're worried about noise disturbing neighbors," "They want to wait until next year."

Agnes provides customized responses with the same three-part structure: what to say, why it works, and backup strategy.

### How to Use Agnes Effectively

**Before customer conversations:** Open Agnes, review common objection scripts, practice responses out loud, memorize key phrases, adapt to your personal style.

**During active calls:** Keep Agnes open on your phone or tablet. When a customer objects, quickly check the script, use Agnes's wording adapted to your voice, follow the strategy provided.

**After difficult calls:** Enter the objection you faced, see how Agnes would handle it, compare to what you said, learn for next time.

### The Psychology of Objection Handling

Agnes doesn't just give you scripts - she teaches you WHY they work. This is crucial. When you understand the psychology, you can adapt on the fly, sound more natural, and build confidence.

For example, the "too expensive" script uses five psychological principles: validation (acknowledging their concern), social proof (other customers felt the same), authority (our premium materials), scarcity (limited warranty), and loss aversion (can you afford NOT to).

Understanding this makes you a better sales professional, not just a script reader.

### Real-World Example

A new rep struggled with the "need to think about it" objection. He'd let customers go, and 80% never called back.

He started using Agnes. The script taught him to uncover the REAL concern: "'I need to think about it' usually means one specific thing is bothering you. Is it the investment, the timeline, or something about the materials? If we can address that one thing, would you be ready to move forward?"

His close rate went from 20% to 45% in six weeks. Agnes gave him confidence and a proven process.

## Chapter 6: Document Job Notes - Quick Field Documentation

### The Documentation Problem

You inspect five properties per day. By the end of the day, details blur together. Was it the Johnson house or the Martinez house that had the chimney damage? Did Sarah want installation before winter or before spring?

Good documentation is the difference between professional service and dropped balls.

### What Document Job Notes Does

Provides a simple, fast note-taking tool for documenting job details, customer information, roof conditions, and next steps. Notes save directly to your Transcription page where you can view them alongside voice recordings.

### Accessing Document Job Notes

From home page, click "Document Job" in the Quick Reference section.

### How to Use It

The interface is simple: one large text area where you type notes.

Here's an example of good job notes:

"Customer contact: John Smith, 555-123-4567, john@email.com
Property: 123 Main St, Boston MA 02101

Roof condition: 20-year architectural shingles, installed 2008
Damage observed:
- Hail damage on north slope, 15-20 impact points
- Missing shingles near chimney, west side
- Minor granule loss throughout
- No visible leaks reported

Customer concerns:
- Cost of replacement
- Timeline - wants done before winter
- Insurance coverage questions

Insurance: State Farm, Claim #12345
Adjuster: Sarah Jones, visiting Friday 2pm

Next steps:
- Send detailed estimate by Friday EOD
- Follow up Monday after adjuster visit
- Discuss financing options if needed
- Schedule installation for October

Estimate range: $8,500-$12,000
Priority: High - pre-winter deadline"

When you click "Save to Transcription," this note is saved and appears immediately in your Transcription page, labeled "Job Note - [timestamp]."

### What to Include in Notes

**Essential information:** Customer name, phone, email, property address.

**Roof observations:** Age, shingle type, damage description, problem areas, overall condition.

**Customer concerns:** Main objections, questions asked, timeline needs, budget concerns.

**Insurance info:** Company name, claim number, adjuster name and contact, visit schedule.

**Next steps:** Your commitments, follow-up dates, documents to send, calls to make.

**Estimates:** Price range, what's included, payment options, timeline.

### Pro Tips

Type while still on-site. Fresh details equal accurate notes.

Be specific. Instead of "some damage," write "15-20 hail impacts, north slope, 1-1.5 inch diameter."

Include timeline always. When you'll follow up, when estimate is due, when work can start, customer's deadlines.

Create your own template and copy/paste each time:
Customer:
Property:
Roof:
Damage:
Concerns:
Insurance:
Next Steps:
Estimate:

### Integration with Transcription

Your notes appear in Transcription alongside voice recordings and meeting transcripts. Everything in one place, searchable by keyword, organized by date.

### Real-World Example

A rep documented every property he visited for one month. At the end of the month, his manager asked about customer retention. He pulled up his notes, searched for "follow up," and found 12 customers he'd promised to call back but forgotten.

He called all 12 that week. Closed 4 deals worth $48,000. Documentation directly led to revenue.

## Chapter 10: Integration and Workflows

### How Features Work Together

The real power of S21 ROOFER comes from using features together in workflows.

### Workflow Example 1: Complete Initial Consultation

**Before meeting:** Ask Susan "What questions should I ask during an initial consultation for a residential roof replacement?" Get list of questions to ask.

**During meeting:** Use Live Conversation if customer asks unexpected technical questions. Record conversation with Voice Transcription.

**After meeting:** Review transcription for key points. Take roof damage photos. Upload photos to Document Analysis, get AI damage assessment. Open Document Job, type quick notes about customer preferences and concerns. Use Email Generator to create follow-up email, pull details from transcription and notes. Copy analysis results into estimate documentation.

**Total time to document meeting, analyze damage, and send follow-up:** 10 minutes. Traditional approach would take 45 minutes.

### Workflow Example 2: Insurance Claim Support

**Step one:** Upload all damage photos to Document Analysis. Add context with claim number and insurance company.

**Step two:** AI generates comprehensive damage assessment.

**Step three:** Copy assessment.

**Step four:** Open Email Generator, select Insurance Communication template.

**Step five:** Paste assessment into context, generate professional adjuster email.

**Step six:** Document interaction in Job Notes for reference.

**Step seven:** Save to Transcription page.

Everything documented, professional email sent, claim moving forward. Total time: 15 minutes.

### Workflow Example 3: Handling Tough Objection

Customer says "Your price is way higher than the other two quotes I got."

**Step one:** Open Agnes, click "Already got other quotes" button.

**Step two:** Get script: "I appreciate you getting multiple quotes - that's smart. The companies that quoted lower are likely cutting corners on materials or warranty. Let me show you exactly what makes our quote higher and why it's actually the better value."

**Step three:** Use script in conversation.

**Step four:** If customer still hesitant, check Agnes backup strategy.

**Step five:** After call, record outcome in Voice Transcription or Document Job Notes.

**Step six:** If customer agrees, generate thank you email with Email Generator.

Agnes gave you confidence and a proven process. Documentation ensures follow-through.
