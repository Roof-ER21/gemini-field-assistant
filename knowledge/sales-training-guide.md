## 1. DOOR KNOCKING & INITIAL CONTACT

### Best Opening Lines That Work

**The Neighbor Approach (Warmest)**
> "Hi, I'm [Name] from [Company]. I just helped Sandra down the street fix her roof after the big hailstorm. I noticed your roof might have similar damage - mind if I take a quick look for free?"

**The SLAP Formula** (Say Hi, Let them know why, Ask open-ended question, Present to their answer)
> "Hi there, I'm [Name]. We're inspecting roofs in [Neighborhood Name] after last week's storm. Have you noticed any issues with your roof since then?"

**The Neighborhood Canvas**
> "Good afternoon! I'm working with a few of your neighbors on [Street Name] after the recent weather. We found some significant damage on [Number] homes already. Would you be open to a free 10-minute inspection?"

**Post-Storm Direct**
> "Hi, my name is [Name] with [Company]. We've been working this neighborhood since the storm came through. A lot of homeowners don't realize they have damage until we point it out - have you had anyone look at yours yet?"

### Getting Past Initial Resistance

**When they say "I'm not interested":**
> "I completely understand. Many homeowners don't realize their roof may have storm damage until we do a free inspection. We're not selling anything today - just documenting damage in the neighborhood. If there's nothing wrong, I'll be out of your hair in 10 minutes. Would that be okay?"

**When they're guarded/suspicious:**
> "I totally get it - there are a lot of companies out there that have given our industry a bad name. Here's my card, my license number, and you can even look us up on Google while I'm standing here. We've been in [City] for [X] years and have [X] reviews. I just want to make sure you're protected."

### Building Immediate Rapport

- **Mirror their body language subtly** - Creates subconscious connection
- **Use their name** - "Mr./Mrs. [Name], I appreciate you taking a moment"
- **Reference visible details** - "Beautiful landscaping, by the way" or "Great neighborhood"
- **Position yourself as a neighbor, not a salesperson** - "I'm just helping folks around here..."
- **Offer something free first** - Inspection, consultation, information

### Timing Strategies

| Timing | Effectiveness | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **24-72 hours post-storm** | HIGHEST | Homeowners are aware and concerned |
| **Late afternoon (4-6pm)** | HIGH | People are home from work |
| **Saturday 10am-2pm** | HIGH | Both decision-makers often home |
| **After seeing damage in neighborhood** | HIGH | Can reference specific homes |
| **During insurance claim window** | HIGH | Most policies have deadlines |

### When NOT to Knock
- Do NOT knock if there's a competitor's yard sign
- Do NOT knock if roof was recently replaced (new materials visible)
- Avoid early morning (before 10am) and dinner time (6-7pm)
- Avoid late evening (after 8pm)

### Converting Cold to Warm Knocking

The minute you finish a roof inspection and start walking back, neighbors notice. If one neighbor trusted you to get on their roof, the next neighbor is more likely to trust you. Use this:

> "I just got off the Johnson's roof two doors down - they had some significant hail damage. Mind if I take a quick look at yours? It only takes about 10 minutes."

## 2. COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### Objection: "I need to think about it"

**Psychology:** This is usually a stall, not a real objection. They're either uncomfortable saying "no" or you missed something in your presentation.

**Best Responses:**

1. **The Clarification Approach:**
> "I completely understand - this is a big decision. Help me understand what specifically you'd like to think through? Is it the timing, the investment, or something about the process?"

2. **The Upfront Contract (Prevention):**
At the START of your presentation, say:
> "Mr./Mrs. [Name], at the end of our conversation today, one of three things will happen: You'll say 'yes, let's move forward,' you'll say 'no, this isn't for us,' or you'll have questions we need to address. I'm okay with any of those - but 'maybe' or 'I need to think about it' usually means I haven't done my job explaining something. Fair enough?"

3. **The Time Sensitivity:**
> "I understand. What I don't want is for you to wait and miss your insurance claim window. Most policies require filing within [X] days of the damage. Can we schedule a follow-up for tomorrow so you have time to discuss but don't lose your opportunity?"

**What NOT to Say:**
- "What do you need to think about?" (confrontational)
- "Go ahead, I'll wait" (destroys rapport)
- Any pushy or aggressive response

---

### Objection: "I'm getting other quotes"

**Psychology:** They want to feel in control and make sure they're getting a fair deal. This is normal behavior.

**Best Responses:**

1. **The Understanding Response:**
> "That's smart - I'd do the same thing. May I ask how many quotes you're planning to get and from which companies? I just want to make sure you're comparing apples to apples when you look at the proposals."

2. **The Differentiation:**
> "Great, that's exactly what I'd recommend. When you're comparing, here's what I'd look for: Are they GAF Master Elite certified? What warranty are they offering? Are they local with a track record? Will they work directly with your insurance? We check all those boxes, and I'm confident we'll be competitive. When do you expect to have all your quotes?"

3. **The Good-Better-Best:**
> "Perfect - let me give you three options so you can compare directly: a basic repair option, our recommended solution, and a premium option. That way, no matter what other quotes come in, you'll have a range to compare against."

**What NOT to Say:**
- "We're the best, you don't need other quotes"
- Badmouthing competitors
- Showing frustration

---

### Objection: "My insurance won't cover it"

**Psychology:** They may have been denied before, heard horror stories, or simply don't understand the process.

**Best Responses:**

1. **The Education Approach:**
> "I hear that concern a lot. Here's the thing - most homeowners don't know that 68% of our projects last year were covered at least 80% by insurance. The key is having proper documentation and knowing how to present the claim. That's exactly what we do. Would you be open to a free inspection? If there's no coverable damage, you've lost nothing."

2. **The Reassurance:**
> "Many homeowners tell me that, and I understand - insurance can be confusing. What type of policy do you have - ACV or RCV? ... Let me explain what's typically covered and what to expect. We handle this every day and can guide you through the entire process."

3. **The Offer:**
> "Here's what I can do: Let me document the damage with photos and measurements. If it turns out insurance won't cover it, you're not obligated to do anything. But at least you'll know exactly what you're dealing with. Fair?"

---

### Objection: "I don't trust roofers"

**Psychology:** They've heard horror stories or had a bad experience. The industry has unfortunately created this perception through "storm chasers" and scam artists.

**Best Responses:**

1. **The Acknowledgment:**
> "I completely understand, and honestly, I don't blame you. There are some terrible operators out there, especially after storms. That's exactly why we're different. Here's my license number, our BBB rating, and we've been in [City] for [X] years with over [X] 5-star reviews. Want to look us up right now while I'm here?"

2. **The Social Proof:**
> "You know what, [Name]? I appreciate your honesty. Let me share something - here are three neighbors on this street alone who we've worked with [show testimonials/photos]. You're welcome to knock on their door and ask about their experience. We stand behind our work with a [X]-year warranty."

3. **The Credentials:**
> "That's fair. Did you know that only 2-3% of roofing contractors qualify for GAF Master Elite certification? We're one of them. That means we've been vetted, we carry proper insurance, and we can offer you the industry's strongest warranty - the Golden Pledge warranty with 50 years of coverage."

---

### Objection: "The price is too high"

**Psychology:** They aren't seeing enough value, or they're comparing you to a cheaper (often lower-quality) option.

**Best Responses:**

1. **The Value Shift:**
> "You feel our price is too high? Help me understand what causes you to think that. Are you comparing us to another quote, or is it the overall investment that's concerning?"

2. **The Investment Frame:**
> "I understand. There's always a difference between a purchase and an investment. A purchase loses value over time. An investment - like a properly installed roof with a 50-year warranty - protects your home's value and pays for itself through energy savings and avoided repairs. Let me show you what you're getting for this investment."

3. **The Quality Comparison:**
> "I appreciate that - price matters. Let me ask: What's the warranty on the other quote? What materials are they using? Are they GAF certified? Are they handling your insurance claim? When you factor in all of that, you'll often find the 'cheaper' option ends up costing more down the road."

4. **The Financing Option:**
> "I hear you on the price. What if we could break this down into monthly payments that fit your budget? Many of our customers pay around $[X]/month with our financing - that's less than their cable bill, and they get a roof that'll last decades."

---

### Objection: "I'll wait until next year"

**Psychology:** They're procrastinating or don't see the urgency. Roof damage only gets worse over time.

**Best Responses:**

1. **The Consequence Frame:**
> "I understand the temptation to wait. Here's what I've seen happen: that small damage becomes a leak, the leak damages your ceiling and insulation, and suddenly a $12,000 repair becomes a $25,000 nightmare. Plus, material costs typically go up 5-10% each year. Would it make sense to at least lock in today's pricing?"

2. **The Insurance Timing:**
> "I want to make sure you don't lose your window. Most insurance policies have a deadline for filing storm damage claims - usually within one year, sometimes less. If you wait, you might be paying 100% out of pocket for something insurance would cover today."

3. **The Season Factor:**
> "I hear you. Just keep in mind that spring/summer is our busiest season, and wait times can extend to 6-8 weeks. If you book now, we can schedule at your convenience and often offer better pricing during our slower periods."

---

### Objection: "My neighbor got a bad job"

**Psychology:** They're using someone else's negative experience as a reason not to trust any roofer.

**Best Responses:**

1. **The Differentiation:**
> "I'm sorry to hear that - unfortunately, it happens more than it should. May I ask which company did their roof? ... We're not them. In fact, we've built our reputation on being the opposite of companies like that. Here's what makes us different: [credentials, warranty, reviews, local presence]."

2. **The Social Proof Flip:**
> "That's frustrating for them. Would it help if I showed you some of the roofs we've done on this street? Better yet, you're welcome to talk to Mrs. [Name] at [address] - we did her roof last year and she'll give you an honest opinion."

3. **The Guarantee:**
> "I understand that concern. That's why we offer a workmanship warranty AND the manufacturer's warranty, plus a 40-point inspection after installation. If anything isn't right, we fix it - period."

---

## 3. INSPECTION PRESENTATION

### How to Present Findings Effectively

**The 3-Step Presentation Flow:**

1. **Show the Overall Context**
> "Let me show you what I found. First, here's an overview of your roof from several angles..."

2. **Walk Through Specific Damage**
> "Now, let me show you the specific areas of concern. This first photo shows [type of damage] near your [location]. You can see here where..."

3. **Explain the Impact**
> "If this isn't addressed, here's what typically happens over time..."

### Photo Documentation That Sells

**Essential Photos to Capture:**
- Overall roof from multiple angles (4 corners minimum)
- Close-ups of specific damage (hail hits, lifted shingles, cracked tiles)
- Granule loss in gutters
- Flashing damage
- Any existing leaks or water staining
- Comparison shots (damaged vs. undamaged areas)

**Pro Tips:**
- Timestamp all photos
- Use a coin or golf ball for scale on hail damage
- Annotate photos to highlight problem areas
- Take photos from the homeowner's perspective (standing in the yard looking up)

### Explaining Damage to Homeowners

**For Hail Damage:**
> "See these circular marks? That's where hail impacted your shingles. Each hit breaks down the protective granules - those are the tiny rocks that protect the shingle from UV rays and water. Once those are gone, your shingle ages rapidly - what should last 20 years might fail in 5."

**For Wind Damage:**
> "These lifted shingles were caused by the wind getting underneath and breaking the seal. Once that seal is broken, water can get under the shingle and into your roof deck. That's when you get leaks and eventually structural damage."

**For Age/Wear:**
> "Your roof is showing signs of normal aging - see how the shingles are curling at the edges and the granules are wearing thin? This is typical for a roof this age. The question is whether we repair the problem areas now or plan for a full replacement in the next 1-2 years."

### Creating Urgency Without Being Pushy

**Educational Urgency:**
> "I'm not here to pressure you - that's not how we operate. What I want you to understand is the timeline we're working with. Your insurance has a claim window, material prices are scheduled to increase, and this damage will only get worse through the next rain or freeze/thaw cycle."

**Consequence-Based:**
> "The decision is absolutely yours. I just want to make sure you have all the information. If this isn't fixed, the water intrusion will eventually damage your [ceiling/insulation/structure]. Catching it now is significantly less expensive than waiting."

## 4. CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### The Comfort Close (Assumptive)

Instead of asking "Do you want to move forward?" ask:
> "Would you prefer a Wednesday or Friday installation?"
> "Which financing option fits your budget better - the 12-month or 60-month plan?"
> "Do you want us to start with the front of the house or the back?"

### The Summary Close

> "Let me make sure I have everything: We're doing a full roof replacement with [material], you'll have a [X]-year warranty, insurance is covering [amount], your out-of-pocket is [deductible], and we can start [date]. Does that all sound right? Great, let me get the paperwork ready."

### The Same-Day Discount Close

> "I'm authorized to offer a 10% discount if we can get the paperwork signed today. That saves you $[amount]. We have a spot opening up next week - should I lock that in for you?"

### The Urgency Close

> "Here's the situation: Material prices are going up [next month/after the storm season/etc.], and we only have [X] installation slots available in the next two weeks. I'd hate for you to lose this pricing or have to wait longer than necessary."

### 5-Step Closing Framework

1. **Proactively overcome objections throughout your presentation**
2. **Ask if they have questions:** "Do you have any questions for me so far?"
3. **Close the loop before closing:** "Does all of this make sense? Any concerns before we talk next steps?"
4. **Go in for the close:** "Let's get the paperwork started so we can get you on the schedule."
5. **Have a backup:** If they hesitate, return to clarifying questions

### Handling the Spouse Objection

**Prevention (Best Strategy) - When Setting the Appointment:**
> "Great, I'll come by at 3pm. Is there another decision-maker in the household who should be present? I want to make sure both of you can ask questions and we're all on the same page."

**If One Spouse is Missing:**
Proceed with the inspection. Take all photos and measurements. Then:
> "I found some significant damage that we should discuss. Rather than go through everything twice, when would be a good time to come back when both you and [spouse's name] are available? I want to make sure you're both informed and can ask questions."

**If They Insist on Proceeding Alone:**
> "I can certainly share everything with you now. Would it be helpful if I left you a complete packet with photos, the proposal, and all the details so you can review with [spouse]? Then I can follow up in a day or two to answer any questions."

## 5. INSURANCE CLAIM EDUCATION

### Explaining the Claim Process

**The Simple Walkthrough:**
> "Here's how the insurance process works:
> 1. I document all the damage with detailed photos and measurements
> 2. You call your insurance company to file a claim
> 3. An adjuster will come out to verify the damage - we'll be here for that meeting
> 4. Insurance approves the claim and sends the first check (your ACV amount minus deductible)
> 5. We do the work
> 6. Insurance releases the depreciation holdback after completion
>
> We handle most of the heavy lifting. You just need to make a phone call and be available for the adjuster."

### Setting Expectations

**On Timeline:**
> "The whole process typically takes 3-4 weeks from filing to approval, sometimes faster after big storms when insurance companies ramp up. Installation usually happens within 1-2 weeks after approval."

**On Coverage:**
> "Most standard homeowner policies cover sudden storm damage - wind, hail, fallen trees. What they typically don't cover is normal wear and tear or maintenance issues. Based on what I see, your damage appears to be storm-related and should be coverable."

**On Out-of-Pocket:**
> "Your out-of-pocket responsibility is usually just your deductible. The insurance company pays the rest directly to you. We'll work to make sure the scope of work matches what insurance approved so there are no surprises."

### When Homeowner is Nervous

**Address Their Fears:**
> "I know filing a claim can feel intimidating, but here's what you should know: Filing a legitimate claim will not raise your rates - that's a common misconception. What can affect your rates is not fixing the damage and having repeated water intrusion claims later."

**Provide Reassurance:**
> "We've helped hundreds of homeowners through this exact process. We'll be there for the adjuster meeting, we'll help with any supplemental documentation, and we won't start work until you have approval in writing. You're protected throughout."

### If Claim is Denied

> "Don't worry - a denial isn't always final. We can help you file an appeal. An independent adjuster will re-inspect, and we'll provide additional documentation. We've successfully overturned many denials. Let's not give up yet."

## 6. FOLLOW-UP STRATEGIES

### Timing for Follow-Ups

| Touchpoint | Timing | Method | Message |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Initial Follow-Up** | Same day | Text + Email | Thank you + summary |
| **First Check-In** | 24 hours | Phone call | "Did you have a chance to review?" |
| **Second Touch** | 3-5 days | Text or Email | Answer questions, provide value |
| **Urgency Reminder** | 7-10 days | Phone call | Check timeline, mention deadlines |
| **Re-engagement** | 14-21 days | Email + Call | New information, weather update |
| **Nurture** | 30+ days | Email | Move to long-term nurture list |

### Multi-Touch Sequences

**Day 1 (Same Day):**
Text: "Hi [Name], it was great meeting you today! Attached are the photos from your roof inspection. Let me know if you have any questions. - [Your Name]"

**Day 2 (24 Hours):**
Call: "Hi [Name], this is [Name] from [Company]. I wanted to follow up on our conversation yesterday and see if you had any questions about the inspection or the next steps?"

**Day 4:**
Text: "Hi [Name]! Just checking in. Have you had a chance to discuss the roof with [spouse]? Happy to answer any questions. Also, just FYI - we have a couple installation slots opening up next week if you're ready to move forward."

**Day 7:**
Call: "Hi [Name], quick call to see where you're at in your decision. I want to make sure you don't miss your insurance claim window. Any questions I can answer?"

**Day 14:**
Email: "Subject: Quick Update on Your Roof"
"Hi [Name], I wanted to touch base. There's another storm system coming through next week, and I wanted to remind you that your roof has some vulnerable areas. If you're ready to move forward, we can get you scheduled before the weather hits. Let me know!"

### Re-Engaging Cold Leads

**After 30 Days of Silence:**
> "Hi [Name], I haven't heard from you in a few weeks, so I wanted to check in. I understand if timing wasn't right before, but I wanted to let you know we're running a [promotion/special] this month. Also, has your situation changed at all? I'm here if you have questions."

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't call more than once per day
- Don't be aggressive or guilt-trip
- Don't give up after one "no" - but do know when to stop

### Speed to Lead

Research shows contacting prospects within 5 minutes doubles your close rate compared to 30-minute delays. Post-storm, the first roofer to call back wins trust and mindshare.

---

## 7. TRUST BUILDING

### Credentials to Mention

**GAF Master Elite Certification:**
> "We're one of only 2-3% of roofing contractors nationwide who qualify for GAF Master Elite certification. That means we've been vetted for proper licensing, insurance, and workmanship, and we can offer you GAF's Golden Pledge warranty - 50 years of coverage on materials plus 25 years on workmanship."

**Certifications to Highlight:**
- GAF Master Elite (or GAF Certified)
- BBB Rating (A+ preferred)
- Years in business
- Local presence
- State licensing
- Insurance coverage (liability + workers' comp)

### Reviews and Referral Strategies

**Leveraging Reviews:**
> "We have over [X] five-star reviews on Google. Would you like to see what your neighbors are saying about us? ... [Show on phone] ... Mrs. Johnson just left this review last week after we completed her roof."

**Offering References:**
> "If you'd like, I can give you the contact information for three homeowners we've worked with in this area. Feel free to call them and ask about their experience."

**Building Social Proof:**
> "You know, [Name] two doors down had us do their roof after the same storm. They're happy to talk to you if you want an honest opinion from a neighbor."

### Warranty Explanation That Builds Confidence

**The Golden Pledge Difference:**
> "Here's what makes our warranty different: With GAF Golden Pledge, you get 50 years of coverage on materials AND 25 years on workmanship. Plus, after we're done, GAF sends an independent inspector to do a 40-point quality check. If anything isn't perfect, we fix it before we leave. That's peace of mind you won't get from most contractors."

**Key Warranty Points to Cover:**
1. What's covered (materials, labor, installation)
2. How long it's covered
3. What happens if there's an issue
4. Is it transferable (adds home value)
5. Who backs it (manufacturer vs. contractor)

### What Homeowners Actually Care About

Based on analysis of 1,642+ reviews:
1. **Friendliness** - Homeowners love dealing with nice people
2. **Communication** - Clear, constant, transparent updates
3. **Professionalism** - Show up when you say, do what you promise
4. **Quality Work** - Clean job sites, attention to detail
5. **Value** - Not cheapest, but fair for what they get
