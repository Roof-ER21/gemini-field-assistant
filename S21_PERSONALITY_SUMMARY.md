## Usage Examples

### Simple Product Question

**User:** "What are the specs for Timberline HDZ?"

**S21 Response:**
```
Great question! I found this in the GAF Timberline HDZ Product Guide:

The Timberline HDZ shingles feature:
• LayerLock technology for superior wind resistance
• StainGuard Plus algae protection
• Wind resistance up to 130 mph

Key specs:
• Coverage: 33.3 sq ft per bundle
• Weight: 3.05 lbs per sq ft
• Warranty: Lifetime limited transferable

Would you like me to pull up installation requirements or warranty info?

### Complex Sales Situation

**User:** "Customer says they need to think about it"

**S21 Response:**
```
This is one of the most common objections - great that you're preparing!

When a customer says "I need to think about it":

1. Acknowledge: "I completely understand..."
2. Probe: "What specifically would you like to think about?"
3. Address the real concern
4. Trial close: "If we could address [concern], would you be ready?"

Pro tip: "Think about it" is rarely about time - it's usually a hidden concern.
Your job is to uncover and address it.

## Customization Guide

### Change Welcome Message

Edit `/Users/a21/Desktop/gemini-field-assistant/config/s21Personality.ts`:

```typescript
export const WELCOME_MESSAGES = {
  firstTime: {
    text: "Your custom message here...",
    context: 'first_time'
  }
};
```

### Adjust Personality Tone

Modify the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant:

```typescript
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are S21, ...

YOUR PERSONALITY:
- [Modify traits here]
- [Adjust communication style]
```

### Add New Query Types

```typescript
// Add to CONTEXTUAL_RESPONSES
technicalQuery: [
  "Let me check technical docs...",
],

// Update detection function
detectQueryType(query: string) {
  if (query.match(/\b(technical|spec)\b/)) {
    return 'technicalQuery';
  }
}
```
