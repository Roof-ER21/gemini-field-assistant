# RAG Implementation Summary

## Project: S21 Chat - Retrieval Augmented Generation

### Completion Date: October 26, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a complete RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for the S21 Chat application. The system automatically enhances chat responses by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base of 50+ roofing sales documents and including them as context for the Gemini AI.

### Key Achievement

Sales reps can now ask natural questions like "What's the initial pitch script?" and receive accurate, source-cited answers pulled directly from the company's official documentation.

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Initial Pitch Script

**User:** "What's the initial pitch script?"

**System:**
1. Detects RAG-relevant query (keyword: "script", "pitch")
2. Searches knowledge base
3. Finds: Initial Pitch Script (relevance: 8.3)
4. Loads full document content
5. Sends enhanced prompt to Gemini

**Response:**
```
According to [Document 1: Initial Pitch Script], here are the 5 non-negotiables
with every pitch:

1. Who you are
2. Who we are and what we do (Roof ER)
3. Make it relatable
4. What you're there to do (an inspection)
5. Go for the close (them agreeing to the inspection)

The script recommends knocking on the door/ringing the doorbell, and as they
open the door, smile and wave...

### Example 2: Insurance Requirements

**User:** "What are the Maryland insurance matching requirements?"

**System:**
1. RAG triggered
2. Retrieves 3 Maryland insurance documents
3. Combines content as context
4. Gets comprehensive answer

**Response:**
```
Based on [Document 1: Maryland Insurance Administration Matching Requirement 1],
Maryland requires insurers to...

Additionally, [Document 2: Maryland Insurance Administration Matching Requirement 2]
specifies that...

[Document 3: Maryland Insurance Administration Matching Requirement 3] covers...

```typescript
const ragContext = await ragService.buildRAGContext(originalQuery, 3);
// Change 3 to adjust number of documents
```

### RAG Trigger Keywords

**Location:** `/services/ragService.ts` line 96

```typescript
const ragKeywords = [
  'script', 'pitch', 'email', 'template', 'insurance',
  // Add more keywords here
];
```

### Relevance Score Weights

**Location:** `/services/knowledgeService.ts` line 133

```typescript
if (nameLower === queryLower) relevance += 5.0;  // Adjust weight
if (categoryLower === queryLower) relevance += 3.0;
// etc.
```
