## Mobile App Notes

When using on iOS via Capacitor:

1. **Location Access**:
   - First time you check in, you'll be asked for location permission
   - This helps track which areas you're working in
   - You can still check in if you deny location access

2. **Background Activity**:
   - Keep the app open while checked in for accurate duration tracking
   - The timer continues even if you switch apps briefly

3. **Offline Mode**:
   - Check-ins require internet connection
   - If offline, wait until you have signal to check in/out

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Check In Immediately**: Check in as soon as you arrive at a territory
2. **Accurate Stats**: Enter accurate numbers when checking out for better analytics
3. **Regular Updates**: Check the leaderboard to see how your territory is performing
4. **Notes**: Use the notes field to record important observations or challenges

## Troubleshooting

**Can't Check In?**
- Make sure you're not already checked into another territory
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have territories assigned to you

**Leaderboard Not Showing Data?**
- Check-out at least once to populate leaderboard stats
- Refresh the page if data seems stale

**Location Errors?**
- Location is optional - you can still check in without it
- Check your device location settings if you want to enable it
- On iOS, go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services

- Refresh the Territory Manager page
- Check your internet connection

## Privacy & Data
