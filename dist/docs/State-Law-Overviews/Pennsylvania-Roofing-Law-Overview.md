# Pennsylvania Roofing Law Overview (Quick Reference)

Audience: S21 (Susan) and Roof-ER field reps. Use as quick, non-legal guidance. Confirm with local AHJ.

Key Points
- Building Code: Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code (UCC), enforced by local municipalities.
- Matching: Not mandated by statewide law unless a policy specifically includes matching endorsement.
- Strategy: Highly effective to leverage permit outcomes (e.g., permit denials requiring full replacement), repairability, and code compliance.
- Permits: Strict local enforcement. Permit requirements and outcomes vary by township/city.
- Licensing: Home Improvement Contractor registration required for residential work.

Use Cases
- Partial approvals: If permit is denied for partial scope, request full replacement citing the denial and applicable code language.
- Documentation: Include permit decision, code citations when available, and clear photographic evidence.

Disclaimer: This is general guidance. Confirm with local officials and policy language.
