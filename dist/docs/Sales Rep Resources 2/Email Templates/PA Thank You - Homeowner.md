## Pennsylvania-Specific Language Points

### Insurance Context (if claim was approved):
"Your insurance company has approved coverage. We'll ensure full compliance with Pennsylvania's Uniform Construction Code (2018 IRC with PA amendments). Pennsylvania townships may require permits for roof work - we handle all permit applications."

### After Initial Meeting:
"I've documented the storm damage to your roof and will be submitting a detailed claim package to [Insurance Company]. Pennsylvania has strict permit requirements, and some townships deny repair permits on roofs over 15 years old - we can use this to strengthen your claim for full replacement."

### After Signing Contract:
"Your contract complies with Pennsylvania HIC regulations. All work will be performed to Pennsylvania's UCC standards with proper permits obtained from [Township Name]."

## Tone Guidelines

- **Warm & Appreciative**: Show genuine gratitude
- **Reassuring**: Address common homeowner anxieties
- **Professional**: Maintain Roof-ER's reputation
- **Clear**: Provide specific next steps and contact info

## When to Use

1. After homeowner signs contract
2. After insurance claim approval
3. After initial consultation (as follow-up)
4. After completing inspection
5. As post-project thank you (see separate template)

## Customization Variables

Dear Robert and Lisa,

Thank you for choosing Roof-ER to handle your roofing project at 789 Maple Avenue, Pittsburgh. We genuinely appreciate your trust in our team.

It was great meeting with you yesterday and assessing the wind damage to your roof. I've already begun preparing the documentation for your Nationwide claim.

**What happens next:**

1. **Insurance Processing**
   - I'll submit your claim package to Nationwide by end of business today
   - You should hear from adjuster Mike Thompson within 3-5 business days
   - I'll attend the inspection and handle all adjuster communications

2. **Permit & Timeline**
   - Pittsburgh building permit application (we handle this)
   - Estimated start date: 2-3 weeks after claim approval and permit
   - Expected duration: 1-2 days (weather permitting)
   - We'll confirm 48 hours before installation

3. **Your Roof-ER Team**
   - Your dedicated representative: Tom Williams - (412) 555-1234
   - Project manager: Steve Brown - (412) 555-5678
   - Office: (412) 555-ROOF

**Pennsylvania-Specific Assurances:**

As Pittsburgh homeowners, you're protected by:
- PA Home Improvement Contractor Registration #PA123456
- Verified through PA Attorney General's Office
- Pittsburgh building permit compliance (we handle all permits)
- Uniform Construction Code (UCC) compliance (2018 IRC)
- $2M liability insurance coverage
- GAF Master Elite certification (Top 3% of contractors nationwide)

**Pennsylvania Permit Advantage:**

Your roof was installed in 2005 (19 years old). Many Pennsylvania townships, including Pittsburgh, deny repair permits on roofs over 15 years old due to code changes. This strengthens your case for full replacement with insurance - we can document the permit denial as proof that repairs aren't viable.

**Questions or Concerns?**

Please don't hesitate to reach out:
- Call/text me directly: (412) 555-1234
- Email: tom.williams@roofer.com
- Office: (412) 555-ROOF

I'm available 7 days a week, 7am-9pm.

Thank you again for your business. We look forward to delivering the quality roof your home deserves.
