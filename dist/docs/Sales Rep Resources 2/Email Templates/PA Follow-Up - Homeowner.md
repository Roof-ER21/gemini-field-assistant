Dear [Homeowner Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on [our meeting/your roof assessment/your insurance claim] for your property at [Property Address].

**Where We Are:**

[Choose appropriate context:]

**After Initial Meeting:**
Since our meeting on [Date], I've [prepared your detailed proposal/submitted your claim to Insurance Company/completed the inspection report]. I wanted to make sure you received everything and answer any questions you might have.

**After Claim Submission:**
I submitted your claim package to [Insurance Company] on [Date]. Typically, adjusters respond within 3-5 business days. I'll keep you updated as soon as I hear from them.

**After Proposal Sent:**
I sent over your detailed proposal on [Date]. I know it's a lot of information to review - I'm happy to walk through any section that needs clarification.

**Next Steps:**

1. **If you have questions** - Call/text me anytime: [Rep Phone]
2. **If you're ready to move forward** - We can [schedule installation/finalize paperwork/submit your claim]
3. **If you need more time** - No problem! Take the time you need, and I'll check back in [timeframe]

**Pennsylvania-Specific Update:**

[Choose relevant section:]

**For Insurance Claims:**
Pennsylvania townships are increasingly strict about roof repairs. [Township Name] often denies repair permits on roofs over 15 years old, requiring full replacement to meet current code. We can use this permit denial to strengthen your insurance claim - documented proof that repairs aren't viable.

**For Cash Customers:**
All work will be performed to Pennsylvania's Uniform Construction Code (UCC) standards. We're PA HIC registered (#[XXXX]) through the Attorney General's Office and carry $2M liability coverage for your protection. We handle all [Township] permit applications.

**Questions I'm Here to Answer:**

- Timeline questions (including permit processing)?
- Insurance coverage concerns?
- Product/warranty questions?
- Financing options?
- Anything else?

**My Commitment to You:**

Whether you move forward with Roof-ER or not, I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision for your home. No pressure - just support.

Feel free to call or text me directly: [Rep Phone]

Best regards,

## Follow-Up Timing Guide

### First Follow-Up:
- **After initial meeting**: 24-48 hours
- **After proposal sent**: 2-3 days
- **After claim submission**: Weekly updates
- **After no response**: 1 week

### Second Follow-Up:
- **If no response to first**: 5-7 days later
- **If questions remain**: Within 24 hours of their inquiry
- **If waiting on insurance**: Every 5-7 days

### Final Follow-Up:
- **Before closing file**: 2-3 weeks after last contact
- **Seasonal reminder**: 6 months later (storm season)

## Pennsylvania Context-Specific Variations

### After Storm Event:
"I wanted to follow up after [Storm Name/Date]. Many homes in your area sustained damage. Pennsylvania insurance law requires claims be filed within a reasonable time. If you haven't already, I recommend scheduling a free inspection. Also, [Township] may have strict permit requirements that favor full replacement."

### After Adjuster Meeting:
"Following our meeting with [Adjuster Name] yesterday, I've documented [X areas of concern]. Pennsylvania townships often deny repair permits on older roofs - I'm checking with [Township] building department to see if we can get documentation that repairs would be denied. This is powerful evidence for insurance to approve full replacement."

### After Denial:
"I received [Insurance Company]'s denial letter regarding your claim. Don't worry - denials are common and often overturned. In Pennsylvania, we have a unique advantage: township permit denials. If [Township] won't permit repairs on your [Age]-year-old roof, insurance must approve replacement. I've successfully used this strategy on [X]% of appeals. Here's our plan..."

### After Approval (Lowball):
"[Insurance Company] approved your claim for $[Amount]. However, this appears to be a lowball offer that doesn't account for Pennsylvania permit fees, code upgrade requirements, or proper UCC compliance. I've identified $[Additional Amount] in missing items including permit costs and code-mandated upgrades. Let me walk you through the supplement process."

### After Permit Denial:
"Great news! [Township] building department has confirmed they will NOT issue a repair permit for your roof due to [code changes/age/extent of damage]. This is documented proof that repairs aren't viable - exactly what we need to force insurance to approve full replacement. I'm preparing the supplement now with this documentation attached."

## Example Full Email (After Proposal Sent)

Subject: Following up - Any questions about your Roof-ER proposal?

---

Dear Karen,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on the proposal I sent over on Tuesday for your Allentown home.

**Where We Are:**

I've prepared a comprehensive estimate for your full roof replacement, including:
- GAF Timberline HDZ shingles (Pewter Gray - to match existing)
- Full tear-off and disposal
- Ice & water shield upgrades per 2018 IRC/UCC
- [Township] building permit (we handle all paperwork)
- 25-year workmanship warranty
- GAF Lifetime System warranty

**Pennsylvania-Specific Details:**

Your roof was installed in 2006 (18 years old). I checked with [Township] building department - they typically deny repair permits on roofs over 15 years old due to code changes since 2006. This is excellent leverage for your State Farm claim, as it provides documented proof that repairs aren't viable under current Pennsylvania code.

**Permit Denial Strategy:**

If we attempt to get a repair permit and [Township] denies it (likely), we can use that denial letter as evidence to State Farm that full replacement is required. This often converts partial approvals into full replacement approvals.

**Next Steps - Your Choice:**

1. **Have questions about the proposal?** Call/text me: (610) 555-1234
2. **Ready to move forward with the claim?** I can submit to State Farm tomorrow
3. **Want me to check on permit requirements first?** I can contact [Township] and get documentation
4. **Need more time to decide?** No problem - take the time you need

**I'm Here to Help:**

Whether you have technical questions about the materials, want to discuss the insurance/permit process, or need clarification on anything - I'm available 7 days a week.

A few common questions I get at this stage:
- "How long does the insurance process take?" (2-3 weeks in PA, including permit time)
- "What if State Farm approves less than your estimate?" (We supplement - at no cost to you)
- "How does the permit process work?" (We handle everything - typically 5-7 business days)
- "When could you start?" (Usually 3-4 weeks after claim approval and permit)

Feel free to call or text anytime: (610) 555-1234

P.S. I noticed when we met that your garage has visible sagging from snow load damage. This is separate from the wind damage claim - we should document both issues. Let me know if you'd like me to include the garage in the assessment.

## Pennsylvania Legal Compliance

**MUST Include:**
- PA HIC Registration number on all written communications
- Accurate representation of insurance/permit process
- No guarantees of claim or permit approval
- Professional registration references

**MUST NOT:**
- Guarantee insurance outcomes
- Make unauthorized legal claims
- Pressure customers with false urgency
- Promise permit approval (townships decide)

**RECOMMENDED:**
- Reference Pennsylvania-specific regulations factually
- Leverage township permit requirements strategically
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Document all communications

## Pennsylvania Permit Leverage Strategy

**Key Arguments for PA Claims:**
1. **Permit Denials**: Townships deny repair permits on old roofs
2. **Code Upgrades**: Current UCC requires features not on old roofs
3. **Manufacturer Warranty**: Repairs void warranty
4. **Safety Compliance**: Partial repairs don't meet UCC
5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Permits + repairs cost more than replacement

**Pennsylvania's Unique Advantage:**
- Many townships deny repair permits on roofs >15 years old
- Code changes since original installation require upgrades
- Documented permit denial = proof repairs aren't viable
- Insurance must approve replacement if repairs are unpermittable

## Tracking & Follow-Up System

**Use CRM to track:**
- Date of each follow-up sent
- Customer response (or lack thereof)
- Permit status inquiries
- Next scheduled follow-up
- Status: Active, Waiting, Permit Check, Closed

**Escalation Path:**
- 1st follow-up: Rep
- 2nd follow-up: Rep + permit status check
- 3rd follow-up: Sales Manager check-in
- 4th follow-up: Final attempt before seasonal reminder

**When to Stop Following Up:**
- Customer explicitly declines
- 3 follow-ups with no response (move to seasonal list)
- Customer chooses competitor
- Claim denied and appeal unsuccessful

## Pennsylvania Township Permit Notes

**Common PA Township Policies:**
- Deny repair permits on roofs >15-20 years old
- Require code upgrades for partial work
- Mandate permits for any roofing over certain square footage
- Enforce current UCC even on old roofs

**How to Use This:**
1. Check township policy before submitting claim
2. Document permit requirements/denials
3. Include permit denial letter in insurance supplement
4. Frame replacement as "required by local ordinance"
