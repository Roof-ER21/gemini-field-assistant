## Virginia-Specific Language Points

### Insurance Context (if claim was approved):
"Your insurance company has approved coverage. We'll ensure full compliance with Virginia's 2021 Residential Code and all applicable building standards. Virginia law doesn't have matching requirements like Maryland, so we'll focus on the repairability argument."

### After Initial Meeting:
"I've documented the storm damage to your roof and will be submitting a detailed claim package to [Insurance Company]. In Virginia, we focus on demonstrating that repairs aren't viable due to shingle brittleness, age, and safety concerns."

### After Signing Contract:
"Your contract complies with Virginia contractor regulations. All work will be performed to Virginia's 2021 Residential Code standards by our Class A licensed team."

## Tone Guidelines

- **Warm & Appreciative**: Show genuine gratitude
- **Reassuring**: Address common homeowner anxieties
- **Professional**: Maintain Roof-ER's reputation
- **Clear**: Provide specific next steps and contact info

## When to Use

1. After homeowner signs contract
2. After insurance claim approval
3. After initial consultation (as follow-up)
4. After completing inspection
5. As post-project thank you (see separate template)

## Customization Variables

Required:
- `[Homeowner Name]`
- `[Property Address]`
- `[Rep Name]`
- `[Rep Phone]`
- `[Rep Email]`

Optional (context-dependent):
- `[Insurance Company]`

- `[Start Date]`
- `[Project Duration]`

## Pro Tips

1. **Send within 24 hours** of meeting/signing
2. **Personalize**: Reference specific conversation points from your meeting
3. **Include photo**: Attach a picture of the damage or completed inspection
4. **Set expectations**: Be specific about timelines
5. **Provide value**: Link to Roof-ER resources (care guide, warranty info)

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for choosing Roof-ER to handle your roofing project at 456 Oak Street, Richmond. We genuinely appreciate your trust in our team.

It was great meeting with you yesterday and assessing the hail damage to your roof. I've already begun preparing the documentation for your State Farm claim.

**What happens next:**

1. **Insurance Processing**
   - I'll submit your claim package to State Farm by end of business today
   - You should hear from adjuster Tom Wilson within 3-5 business days
   - I'll attend the inspection and handle all adjuster communications

2. **Project Timeline**
   - Estimated start date: 2 weeks after claim approval
   - Expected duration: 1-2 days (weather permitting)
   - We'll confirm 48 hours before installation

3. **Your Roof-ER Team**
   - Your dedicated representative: Dave Smith - (804) 555-1234
   - Project manager: Chris Johnson - (804) 555-5678
   - Office: (804) 555-ROOF

**Virginia-Specific Assurances:**

As a Richmond homeowner, you're protected by:
- Virginia Class A Contractor License #2705-123456
- Verified through Virginia DPOR (dpor.virginia.gov)
- 2021 Virginia Residential Code compliance
- $2M liability insurance coverage
- GAF Master Elite certification (Top 3% of contractors nationwide)

**Virginia Claim Strategy:**

Unlike Maryland, Virginia doesn't have matching laws. Our approach focuses on:
- Documenting shingle brittleness (your 2009 shingles won't re-seal)
- Safety hazards from partial repairs
- Code compliance requirements
- Cost effectiveness of replacement vs. ongoing repairs

**Questions or Concerns?**

Please don't hesitate to reach out:
- Call/text me directly: (804) 555-1234
- Email: dave.smith@roofer.com
- Office: (804) 555-ROOF

I'm available 7 days a week, 7am-9pm.
