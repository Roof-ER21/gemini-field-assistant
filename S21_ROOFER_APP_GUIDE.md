**What it does:**
Your specialized AI coach for handling customer objections. Get word-for-word scripts for common sales objections with proven psychology-based approaches.

- Custom objection input for any scenario
- Exact scripts to use (word-for-word)
- Explanation of why each approach works
- Backup strategies if customer still resists
- Based on proven sales psychology

**Common objections covered:**
1. **"Too expensive"** - Price objections
2. **"Need to think about it"** - Timing/hesitation
3. **"Got a denial from insurance"** - Insurance denials
4. **"Insurance only paid partial"** - Partial payment issues
5. **"Want to cancel early"** - Cancellation requests
6. **"Already got other quotes"** - Competition objections

**How to use:**
1. Click "Handle Objection" from home page Quick Reference
2. Click a quick objection button OR type your custom objection
3. Agnes provides:
   - 📝 **What to Say:** Exact script to use
   - 💡 **Why It Works:** Sales psychology explanation
   - 🎯 **If They Still Resist:** Backup approach
4. Use the script in your conversation
5. Adjust to your personal style

**Example response format:**
```
Customer says: "It's too expensive"

📝 What to Say:
"I completely understand your concern, and many of our best customers felt the same way initially. But here's what they discovered - when you factor in our lifetime warranty, the premium materials that last 50% longer, and the fact that we handle all insurance paperwork saving you 20+ hours of hassle, the real question becomes: can you afford NOT to invest in quality? Let me show you exactly how this pays for itself..."

💡 Why It Works:
This validates their concern while reframing from cost to value. It uses social proof ("best customers felt the same"), introduces scarcity (warranty, materials), and shifts the conversation to long-term ROI rather than upfront price.

🎯 If They Still Resist:
Ask: "What's your biggest concern about the investment - the upfront cost, or the monthly payment structure? We have financing options that make this more affordable than you might think." Then address their specific concern directly with numbers.
```
