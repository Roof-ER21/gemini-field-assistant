Dear Sarah,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me yesterday to
discuss your roof replacement project at 456 Oak Street. I
enjoyed our conversation and appreciate the opportunity to
help with your hail damage repair.

As we discussed, I understand you're working with State Farm

up with the information you requested:

Estimate & Timeline:
I'm preparing a detailed estimate that I'll have to you by
Friday as promised. The estimate will include material options,
labor costs, and a complete scope of work.

For timeline, once we receive insurance approval, we can
typically begin work within 2-3 weeks and complete a project
of your size in 3-5 days, weather permitting.

Warranty Information:
We offer comprehensive warranty coverage including:
- 50-year manufacturer's warranty on materials
- 10-year workmanship guarantee
- Lifetime support from our team

Next Steps:
1. I'll send your detailed estimate by Friday
2. Review with your adjuster when they visit
3. Once approved, we'll schedule your installation
4. You'll have a beautiful new roof in less than a week!

Please don't hesitate to call or text if you have any
questions before Friday. I'm here to make this process as
smooth as possible for you.

Looking forward to working together!

- "I'll follow up on Monday"

### 3. Include Numbers
Reference specific details:

### 4. Set Clear Next Steps
End every email with what happens next:

- "Please review and let me know if you have questions"
- "Once you approve, we'll schedule installation"

### 5. Keep Context Conversational
Don't worry about perfect grammar in your context - the AI will clean it up!
