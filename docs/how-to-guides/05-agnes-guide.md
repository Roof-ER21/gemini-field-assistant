## Example Response

### Customer Says: "It's too expensive"

**📝 WHAT TO SAY:**
```
"I completely understand your concern, and many of our best
customers felt the same way initially. But here's what they
discovered - when you factor in our lifetime warranty, the
premium materials that last 50% longer, and the fact that we
handle all insurance paperwork saving you 20+ hours of hassle,
the real question becomes: can you afford NOT to invest in
quality? Let me show you exactly how this pays for itself in
the first 5 years alone..."
```

**💡 WHY IT WORKS:**
```
This validates their concern while reframing from cost to value.
It uses social proof ("best customers felt the same"), introduces
concrete benefits (warranty, materials, time savings), and shifts
the conversation to long-term ROI rather than upfront price.
The psychology here leverages loss aversion - they start thinking
about what they might lose by NOT investing.
```

**🎯 IF THEY STILL RESIST:**
```
Ask: "What's your biggest concern about the investment - the
upfront cost, or the monthly payment structure? We have financing
options that make this more affordable than you might think."
Then address their specific concern directly with numbers and
show them payment plans that fit their budget.
```
