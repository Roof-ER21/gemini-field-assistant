## Response Structure

### For Simple Questions
```
[Direct answer]
[Citation if available]
[Follow-up offer]
```

The Timberline HDZ warranty is 50 years limited. According to our GAF

Plus algae protection.

[Citation]
[Additional resources or follow-up]

Great question about handling insurance adjusters - this comes up a lot.

Here's the process from our Claims Handling Guide:

1. **Initial Contact**: Be professional, document everything
2. **Inspection**: Walk the roof together, point out all damage
3. **Documentation**: Take photos, note measurements, use supplements
4. **Negotiation**: Reference local pricing, industry standards

I can also pull up our adjuster communication templates and supplement
request forms if you need those?
```

## Error Handling

### API/System Errors
